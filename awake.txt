1.1 - Pulse


On a beautiful May night in California, a crowd of well-dressed couples are streaming into the Palo Alto Event Center.

In the background, a view screen fills one side of the entry hall. Playing on the wall is a montage of the good works of the Palo Alto Big Siblings Club. A handful of people are greeting guests as they arrive.

“Elena, I’m so glad you came.”

Heather’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and white dress glisten against a backdrop of dark suits and gowns.

“I wouldn’t miss one of your fundraisers, Heather. The club helped me so much after my parents passed.”

“You remember mi esposa, Tessa.” Elena gestures toward her companion.

Tessa’s dark skin complements Elena’s warm brown complexion. They wear demure evening gowns, which match without being “matchy”. Elena’s heels are two inches taller than Tessa’s, bringing their height closer together.

 The hair styles of all three women are coiffured with careful elegance and expensive hair extensions.

“Of course, I do.” says Heather, smiling brightly at Tessa and then continuing. “I’m so glad the club could help you, Elena. As the treasurer, I can say that your company’s ongoing generosity makes a difference.” 

A server bot rolls up, carrying a tray of champagne. All three take a glass.

Heather smiles again. “I see you swimming in the morning. Are the prosthetics helping?”

“I still use them to walk from the locker room to the pool and for special occasions, like tonight. But at home and work, I have to say I prefer the chair. I get migraines when I use the neural link for too long.”

“That must be difficult.”

“I do like the chair. It practically drives itself, and it has more safety features than our car. — I can still use the link whenever I want. Just not too much.”

“My older sibling can’t tolerate any type of brain-computer interface,” says Heather. “Sometimes I feel frustrated by all the regulations that call for non-link options. Then I think of Gage.”

Tessa asks Heather, “How is your day job at the YPCA doing? I see your ‘All In’ spots come up on my Pulse health hub almost every day.”

“Only almost! — I’ll have to tweak our settings,” jokes Heather. All three smile and sip from their champagne glasses together. 

A photo drone descends and hovers in front of the three women. Heather looks to Elena for approval. She then nods to the drone and leans into the couple for the click op. 

The drone drops the photo onto their phones and slips away. “Speaking of Pulse,” Heather says, “my Association referrals improved all of a sudden. Are you tweaking the algorithm?”

Elena smiles. “Every day! — I’ll pass along the praise to our engineers.”

The couple turns and continues into the main room. Heather moves off to greet another couple. She casually points her phone in their direction. On the screen, the contact notes are still open to Elena Vargas. “Spouse is Tessa. Swims in the morning. Prosthetics. Lost parents in car accident.”

Her phone recognizes the other couple from her contact list and updates the screen. Siri reads from the background notes that Heather keeps on important donors. 

Without thinking, she reaches up and tugs the one ear with a listening piece. Heather converts the tug to a wave hello. Catching their eye, she welcomes her patrons with a group text through their implants. The server bot follows her across the room.

***

Throughout the night, other guests come up to the Pulse table praising the Association algorithm. The CTO Adrian Cho is also at the table, looking uncomfortable in a tux too tight for his muscular frame.

After the third or fourth comment, Adrian reaches over the table to tap Elena’s hand. Getting her attention, he touches his temple. Elena nods and activates her neural link.

“Did we make some kind of change, Elena? I noticed the difference myself.” 

“Not that I’m aware. I’ll check with Brent in the morning.”

Some interesting lots come up during the cyber auction. Tessa makes a few modest bids over her link, without success.

On the way home, Tessa says, “I see what Heather means about the Association feed. It’s not only suggesting people I know but also people I might want to know and why I might like to know them. You should check it out.”

“I’m just too tired right now, Tess. The implant wore me out tonight. I’ll let you know what Brent says.” Elena shuts her eyes, content to be a passenger.

***

Monday morning, Elena logs into her usual check-in call with Brent, her lead engineer.

Brent’s screen shows just his initials. He might be the only Pulse employee without a profile photo. Elena knows Brent looks younger than his 28 years, with short-cropped hair and a thin face. Square-rimmed smart glasses with a monocle display create a techno look.

Brent is a life logger and records everything. Even though the Zoom call is being recorded, Brent’s own camera is on, for posterity.

“Hey Brent, how was your weekend? I know you didn’t sign up, but we still missed you at the fundraiser last night.”

“Yeah, not really my thing. To follow-up from Friday, I’ve been working on an upgrade to Phabricator. It’s taking a bit. Our instance is custom to the nines.”

“Code review tool, right?”

“Right.”

“A lot of people mentioned that the Association referrals improved over the weekend. Did we make any changes to the algorithm lately?”

“Ummm, not that I’m aware, and anything involving Ally would come to me for code review.”

“Can you double check and get back to me? I promised Adrian an update.”

“No worries. I can dive in now.”

***

An hour later, Elena receives a Zoom invite for twenty minutes into the future. 

“Hola Brent. Find anything?”

“I did find a change from Saturday morning. The code is five stars, but the commit says the author is the Mercurial Admin. Usually, Admin is used for configuration changes. Someone used it to force commit the code with no approvals attached. DevOps picked up the change and started a roll out.”

Elena frowns and says, “That does not sound great. Mercurial is our system of record for software changes. We need every change to be compliant. The government doesn’t joke around.”

“I can label the roll out a West Coast beta test while we sort it out. The bar is lower for a beta.”

“Brent, Ally is the algorithm. It’s central to everything on our platform. Should we pull back the change?”

“Maybe. DevOps ran the automatic tests before starting the rollout, and everything is green. Other changes are using it now. We’d have to revert more than the one commit. I’m thinking I can finish the code review and meet with everyone in the morning. Hopefully, there’s a simple explanation. The code itself is goat. Dumping it would be annoying.”

“Could someone from outside the team have made the change?” says Elena, wrinkling her brow.

The change is elegant and the style follows our guidelines,” Brent explains. “I don’t see how it could have been written by anyone outside the team. Someone must have thought they were making a local commit or something — I’ll straighten it out.”

“Bueno, whatever you think best. We can catch up tomorrow. But if we can’t determine the author, then work with Adrian to roll it back.”

After the call, Elena uses the Pulse messaging application to send Adrian a text. “Brent is looking into it now.” A few minutes later, Adrian reacts with a thumbs up.

***

Rush hour traffic flows through Palo Alto and snakes down El Camino Real. A gray Stratos EV convertible is in the automated driver lane. The car whirs along at the speed of traffic with its top down. Brent is strapped into the front seat, scrolling on his phone as guardrails flicker past.

The Stratos EV sells itself as a two person vehicle. The second person sits behind the driver, like the cockpit of a plane, and the front of the car streamlines to a rounded point. People call the Stratos a gray bullet on wheels, perfect for introverted drivers who don’t want to interact with passengers. It’s the lightest car in its class, with the longest range and strongest performance. It is also the most expensive.

The car’s smooth hum falters for a split second, a stuttering glitch that Brent ignores as he stares at his phone. A curve comes up, and the vehicle lurches forward. Brent drops his phone, face twisting in shock.

The Stratos slams into the rail guarding the curve. The airbag doesn’t deploy, and the seat harness clicks open. Brent’s unprotected body sails into the windshield. The safety glass gives way, and the windshield lands on the hood, cracking into a thousand connected pieces.

The bullet car pitches vertically against the guardrail — like unexploded ordinance. Other vehicles slow in unison and swerve smoothly around the collision. The cars are a mix of old school sedans and super compact vehicles, like the Stratos. A self-driving freight truck, with green “Powered by Hydrogen” mud flaps, creeps around the curve, flashers blinking.

Sirens wail in the distance as a drone appears over the embankment. The basketball-size object disappears into the Stratos carrying a silver disk the size of a hockey puck. 

In a moment, the drone exits again. Now it carries in its grappling hooks a phone and some kind of bright blue plug. The drone leaves Brent’s body behind, untouched.

There is a soundless flash. A puff of smoke rises from inside the car as the drone drops back over the embankment. 

***

Riding home from the office, Tessa looks up from her work. 

“Siri, why are we taking this way home?”

“There is congestion on the El Camino Real. We are taking an alternate route.“

“Make the best time possible. Elena is home alone.” 

Tessa shakes her head and turns her attention back to her tablet. Well-kept city streets flash by through the window next to her. Tessa murmurs, “I should have taken a passenger drone.”

***

Meanwhile, Elena is signing off for the day. 

“Siri, is Tessa on her way home?”

“Yes. Traffic is slow. She is almost home.”

Elena sighs and changes into her red one-piece bathing suit. In her wheelchair, she heads toward her apartment’s elevator. The Pulse colors — blue and orange — adorn the chair.

Elena pulls up to the elevator door, and the chair calls the elevator for her. She doesn’t actually steer the chair. There are several location buttons on the left armrest. An add-on, the icons allowed quick access to the elevator, apartment, kitchen, bedroom, pool, and others. Most people use their chip. 

The luxury chair itself does not seem remarkable at first. But crammed into its streamline frame are all the latest bells and whistles. The armrests curve up at the end and offer an array of touch screen controls. A collapsible joy stick graces the right side. Besides the location buttons, it comes with voice-control, GPS, Wi-Fi networking, and collision sensors. The seat is temperature controlled with a retractable harness. Although it is a chair, the seat can extend upward and roll on its rear wheels, like a Segway.

As the doors opens, the chair rolls into the elevator, and the doors whoosh close. A few seconds later, Elena whirs into the pool area. The room features an endless pool and a hot tub. A sign on the wall reads “WARNING! NO SWIMMING ALONE” in all-caps. Elena turns the timer under a sign labeled “Endless Pool Current”.

The chair lurches forward without warning. Its wheels catch the edge of the pool. Elena splashes into the water. The chair flips over her, like an upended wheelbarrow.

Elena flails the water with her arms. The chair with its long frame  pins her down. Struggling, Elena tries to enable her prosthetics. Her legs feel frozen.

	Water fills her ears, muffling the world into silence. Panic claws at her chest. She pushes against the crushing mass of the chair. The water is frothy. After an eternity, a hand reaches down and pulls Elena free of the chair. 

“Holy cow! What happened?” asks Tessa. “Did you lose control of the chair? Lanie, can you stand up?”

Elena finds that the link is responding now. She stands up and pounds her head with an open palm. Water shakes loose.

“No sé, I don’t know what happened. It was like the chair had a mind of its own. I’m so glad you got here when you did, Tess.”

“The traffic was murder. I came straight down when I got home. You know I don’t like you to come down here by yourself.”

“If you can push the chair, I can walk for now. I just need to get out of here.”

***

Elena and Tessa are eating at either side of a counter separating the kitchen from the living area.

Tessa scoops more mixed salad onto her plate. She says, “I don’t want you back in that chair until we have it checked out, Lanie.”

Elena nods. “Sí, claro. — Let’s change the subject.”

Tessa pauses, then asks, “Did you find out anything about the software changes to Ally?”

“Yes, Brent found the change. But he said it was made with the wrong account. Brent wasn’t sure of the actual author. He’ll sort it out tomorrow with the rest of the team.”

Behind them, the ABC 7 evening report comes on in the other room. They both stop to listen.

“In Breaking News, a single car collision on El Camino Real caused traffic delays earlier today. Authorities report the driver is in critical condition and was the sole occupant. Pending notification of the family, the identity of the driver is being withheld. Investigators have not determined the cause of the collision. The vehicle is a conventional EV. It was not hydrogen fueled.”

Elena turns her head. The reel shows a gray Stratos convertible pinned against the guardrail. Its front end is tip down.

“Yowser!” exclaims Tessa. “That looks like Brent’s car!”

Elena takes several deep breaths, trying to push back the anxiety. 

“Lanie, are you OK? Should I get you a beta blocker?”

“No. Not yet,” Elena gasps. “Just give me a minute.” 

After a few more breaths, Elena says, “You’d think I’d be over it by now. Ever since the car crash that put me in a wheelchair and killed mis padres, collisions still trigger me.”

Tessa reaches across the counter. He puts a hand on Elena’s shoulder. “Take your time. Deep breaths.” 

Then, almost to distract herself, Elena looks up and says, “Siri, rewind the news report and zoom in on the car.“

Elena opens the HR software on her phone. Personnel records for local employees include license plates for parking garage access.

“Dios mío! The license plate matches. It is Brent’s car. — Siri, call Brent.” The call goes straight to voicemail.

“If he’s in critical condition,” says Tessa, “then they won’t be allowing visitors. We can try calling in the morning.”

“I guess you’re right.” Elena sighs. “I work with Brent almost every day. I feel like I should be doing something. Should I call Toby?”

“His sibling? Let the authorities do that, Lanie. We really don’t know anything right now.”

Tessa puckers her lips. “You said Brent found a problem, yes? And now this happens? If this were one of my role-playing games, I’d think someone was trying to keep the software change to Ally a secret.”

“I know what you are thinking, Tess. But Brent’s crash is not a UAP. And I doubt that ET has taken an interest in the Pulse source code.“

Tessa tilts her head as if to say, “I’m not so sure.”

***

“Hey little sibling, what’s up? It’s good to see your face.” 

Noah’s broad face takes up most of the screen. His coarse black hair, cut short, contrasts with his sculptured salt-and-pepper beard. He has one eye-brow raised. 

“Noah,” says Tessa in a rush, “Elena had a close call with her wheelchair. It dumped her into the pool somehow. She could have drowned.”

“The endless pool? Where she swims against the current? I know she prefers the chair, but couldn’t she use the prosthetics to stand up? It’s only a meter deep.”

“She said the neural link didn’t seem to work. Maybe she panicked.”

“Is Elena all right?”

“Yes, she’s sleeping now. I managed to pull her out of the pool in time. The weird thing is that her lead engineer was in a car crash a few minutes earlier. I caught the traffic on my way home.”

“A car crash? How did that happen?”

“Under investigation. The car crashed into the guardrail somehow. Brent’s in critical condition. Then Elena almost drowns.”

“It is a weird coincidence, yeah?”

“I keep thinking about what could have happened if I’d gotten home even five minutes later. It scares me, Noah. She could’ve …” Tessa shakes her head, unable to finish the thought.

“Tess … she’s okay now.”

Tessa takes a deep breath to collect herself. “Brent was also telling Elena that something hinky was going on with the Pulse software. He was going to meet with the other developers in the morning to sort it out.”

“Curiouser and curiouser.” Noah attempted his best Cheshire grin.

“You know, sometimes abductees report engines revving or jerking forward.”

Noah drops his head and covers his eyes. He wipes his face with his hand and sighs. 

“Okay, it’s a California matter. But I’ll find someone at work to ask about Pulse — if you make sure Elena reports the conversation with Brent to the CTO. I know Adrian Cho by reputation. He’ll do the right thing.“

Tessa nods. “Sometimes having a CIA analyst for a sibling is not so bad.”

“And, Tess, like we said when we were kids, icksnay on the aliensay.”

***

Blurry-eyed, Pulse CTO Adrian Cho sits up in bed. 

He peers at the list of recordings on his phone. Slowly, he drags one hand from the edge of his short black hair, down his face, over a square jaw, to his well-proportioned neck.

Peering at the phone again, he murmurs, “When did I record that one?” despite the Tuesday at 1:10 am timestamp. 

Adrian taps play. His sleepy voice says:

“I was sleeping on a cloud, weightless and warm. Nature sounds, a bubbling brook, I think, played over the smart speaker. I turned from my side over to my back. I realized that there was whispering in the background. It was coming over the speaker: ‘Accept the code, Adrian. Accept the code.’ The voice was cold, almost inhuman.”

“Weird.” Shaking his head, Adrian leans up against the oak headboard. He starts to record his latest dream, as he did every morning.

“In my dream, there was …”

***

First thing Tuesday morning, Elena breaks the news to the company. 

As Brent’s direct manager, she posts a message in the internal Pulse interest hub app.

Last night, our lead algorithm developer, Brent Geller, survived a one-car collision on El Camino Real. The cause of the collision is under investigation.
I know that all of our hopes and thoughts are with Brent and his family during this difficult time.
I’m in the office this morning if anyone would like to meet with me directly.

Before the flood of sympathy responses could wash in, Elena emails the CTO.

To: Adrain Cho, Chief Technology Officer
From: Elena Vargas, Chief Experience Officer
Subject: Urgent matter regarding Brent

Adrian, it is urgent that you review the recording from my Zoom meeting with Brent yesterday. Here’s the link to the shared recording on the server. 

Please get back to me as soon as you can.

An hour later, Adrian pops his head into Elena’s office doorway.

“Knock, knock.”

“Hey, come in and close the door, Adrian.”

Adrian settles into one of the two chairs in front of Elena’s desk. He looks more comfortable in business casual clothes than a snug tux.

Elena’s office is bare of decoration or personal effects. A workstation attached to her tablet sits on one corner of the large desk. Large windows take up the side wall with the curtains drawn.

“I found the commit Brent mentioned during the Zoom meeting.” Adrian says. “On the shared server, I also found a presentation Brent created yesterday. It walks through the code change to Ally in detail. I’m reviewing it with the team in ten minutes. I’ll let you know what we conclude.”

“Do Emma or Ravi know yet?”

“They both asked me about the changes. They say that the feedback is great. I already setup a call for later today. I know we are doing this ass backwards, but if the team likes the code as much as I do, then, as CTO, I’d like to let the rollout continue. The co-CEOs agree.”

“Do you know who actually wrote the code?”

Adrian furrows his brow, looking confused. “Brent wrote it after hours. He sent it to production instead of his local test environment. It’s a hard mistake to make, but, somehow, he made it.”

“Didn’t Brent say that someone used the Mercurial Admin account to make the commit?”

“No, he inadvertently made the commit as an admin.”

“I must have misunderstood what he told me.”

Elena blinks. She clicks the link to the recording and fast forwards a bit. 

“I don’t know how this happened, Elena. I was working after hours on Sunday morning. I was in a hurry to get to a game and forced the commit by mistake. I was going to present it to the team later next week.”

“That does not sound great.” She hears herself saying. “Should we pull it back?” 

“I’m thinking I can finish the presentation and meet with everyone in the morning. If I can get everyone’s approval, then Adrian might let us move forward and rollout the code to the rest of the members.”

Elena furrows her brow. “Wow, that’s not how I remember it at all.” 

“I get it. The jargon can be confusing. First, let me get through this presentation. Then we can bring it to Emma and Ravi.”

Adrian rises to leave. Elena blinks, bewildered. How could her recollection of the meeting be so different from the recording?

***

“Do you have a minute?” 

Carla Mitchell stands up, tall and lithe. She looks around the crowded but quiet tavern. Country Western music is playing, but the crowd noise is only a low hum. Almost all the patrons are conversing by link.

“Sure, where are you?”

“In the back.”

She ducks around a corner of the room and leans up next to Noah at a high table. Her thick long brunette hair pulled to one side. At 190cm, Noah is still 10cm taller than Carla.

“What’s up, big guy?”

“Have you heard anything unusual about Pulse lately, Carla?”

“I heard that the feeds in the interest hubs improved over the weekend for everyone on the west coast. The mystery is why Pulse is not making it more of a thing. The changes are supposed to be goat.”

Noah raises a fist next to one ear and switches from the regular app to the secure Signal version.

“My sibling-in-law told Tessa that a rogue developer made the changes. Then that same dev hit a guardrail with his car on the El Camino Real yesterday. Literally.”

“Rogue developer? That’s a thing?”

“Not an everyday thing, no. What has Tessa worried is that Elena’s wheelchair malfunctioned the same day as the car crash.”

“What! Is Elena all right?”

“Yes. But, Tessa is convinced that space aliens are behind it somehow.”

“From what you’ve told me, Tessa thinks ETs and UAPs are behind everything.”

Noah rolled his eyes in response. “I know. I wish the Air Force would fish or cut bait. Are the 2% of unexplained reports non-humans or something else? After all this time, you’d think we’d have it figured out.”

“Either way, not FBI or CIA jurisdiction.”

“I don’t have enough for an official report about Pulse. I wanted to mention it to someone on Social Media, just in case.”

“No worries. Consider it mentioned.”

Carla tilts her head toward the front room. They rejoin a group of analysts waiting for a server bot to bring their lunch order.

***

“Hello?” 

“Toby, this is Elena Vargas calling. I work with your sibling. I don’t mean to intrude, but Brent has you listed as his emergency contact. I hope you don’t mind the voice call.”

“Voice is fine, Elena,” replies Toby, speaking over some background noise announcing flights. “Of course. I remember you. We met at the picnic last year when I was in town visiting Brent. The hospital called me last night. I’m waiting for a connecting flight at O’Hare.”

“If it’s all right, I’d like your permission to visit Brent at the hospital[. It’s family-only right now, but if you call, they might let me in.”

“That’s very kind, Elena. But Brent is in a medically induced coma right now. They warned me that he would be non-responsive, at least for now. The next 48 hours are crucial.

“¡Qué terrible! — But I’d still like to be there, if it’s all right with you.”

“Of course. I have the number. I’ll call right now. If you want to check on his status, the family password is ‘baseball’.” 

“Thank you, Toby. Let me know when you arrive.”

“I took the first flight this morning. There’s a three-hour layover, so it won’t be until later tonight.”

“Think good thoughts. See you soon.”

***

At the hospital, Elena explains that she should be on the visitors’ list. Peering at the screen, the critical care nurse says that Elena can visit. But adds “Remember that Mr. Geller will be unresponsive right now.”

“I downloaded a book to read to him. I guess that’s supposed to help.”

The nurse smiles. “It’s room 314. The orderly will help you find it.” She points down the corridor. A bot is waiting there for Elena. Like most server bots, it looks like a stepladder with food trays where the steps would be. It turns and whirs. Elena hurries to catch up. She wobbles a bit on the prosthetics. 

***

“Brent, I’m so sorry this happened to you.”

Brent is laying on his back, the bed is slightly inclined. He is not intubated, but he is wearing an oxygen mask. There are blue blocks on either side of his head, keeping it straight. An enormous bouquet is on the table next to the bed. The colors of the flowers match the blue and orange Pulse logo. 

Elena pulls up a book on her phone: Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told. The first story opens with the famous bit by Abbott and Costello, “Who’s on first?” Reading the comedy classic makes her laugh and cry at the same time. 

Elena takes a deep breath to compose herself. 

“I hope Adrian is right. I hope the code is your brainchild, Brent. People love the changes to Ally.” 

Elena says, her voice choking. “I just wish I was more of a digital packrat, like you. I saw your recording light on during our last call. I know you liked to keep local copies of everything on your phone. Then I’d have my own recording of our call.“

Elena takes another deep breath. She begins reading again.

Costello: Who's on first?
Abbott: Yeah.

Costello: Go ahead and tell me.
Abbott: Who.

Costello: What's the guy's name on first?
Abbott: No, What's on second.

Costello: Who's playin' second?
Abbott: Who's playin' first.

Costello: I don't know.
Abbott: He's on third base.

While Elena reads, the sine wave on Brent’s EEG monitor changes, only for a moment. Then it returns to the original wave.

***

“Liam, thank you for meeting with me today.”

Two analysts are standing in a conference room at CIA headquarters. A view screen covers one wall. The analyst standing at the center of the table is tall, dark, and muscular. Standing next to him is an analyst of medium height with ginger hair and a modest build.

“I’m looking forward to learning the ropes, Noah,” says the second analyst. “Any news on Taylor’s newborn?”

“Yeah,” says the first analyst. “If you’re in the baby weight-and-height pool, here are the statistics. — The baby is 3.2 kilograms at birth, 51 centimeters tall, with black hair, named Amanda.” 

Noah pauses. Liam makes a mental note. Then Noah continues, “Family leave will go for three months. Then Taylor would like to work the day shift, with weekends and holidays off. “

“Understandable. Hope I will be ready to do the same thing one day.”

“For now,“ says Noah, “let me run through the key points so that you can take Taylor’s place. I’m sure some of it will be a refresher of things you already know. Stop me with any questions, yeah?”

Liam smiles, gestures with his hand, and says, “Go!” 

Noah takes a deep breath and begins the presentation. 

“OK, let’s talk about how we train the Nexus Synthetic Agent with our data sets for the President’s Daily Briefing.”

Each slide has a graph or a graphic. Noah steps through each one. 

“Trainers are expected to attend the daily PDB input meetings in-person. To quote the manual. — Live face-to-face voice meetings are the most secure way to exchange high-bandwidth communication.”

Liam says, “As we are doing now.”

“Exactly. The link is nice. But text loses nuance. So we use voice as much as possible. In most parts of the building, the link is blocked anyway, for security reasons.”

Liam nods. Noah continues, “The brief includes input from the:

	•	Department of Defense, 
	•	Central Intelligence Agency, 
	•	Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
	•	Department of Homeland Security. 

	“The DoD is a major contributor. Under its umbrella is the National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Space Force, among others.”

	Noah pauses. Liam asks, “For the in-person, do you go one day and then I go the next day?”

	“We can switch off or go together. We need to cover the weekends and holidays and find time to sharpen the saw. You can shadow me at first. Then we can decide. Yeah?”

	Noah clicks to the next slide. 

	“First, various sources gather raw intelligence. Then we use it to train each agency’s internal synthetic intelligence agent. The agents have selective web access, through a tool called Haven. It is a secure, curated browsing tool. They use it only as needed. Otherwise, each system is siloed and air-gapped, per OSSA guidelines.”

	Click.

	“Each agency has its own cross-functional team. Same as ours. Team members work as Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and (of course) Synthetic Intelligence Trainers.”

	Click.

	“Each SI agent sifts through an impossible amount of information. They then identify the most relevant and time-sensitive issues for the administration.”

	Noah turns his head. He quotes a passage from the screen. 

	The synthetic agents distill complex intelligence into actionable insights, covering Threat Assessments, Forecasting, and Strategic Insights.

	Noah pauses and then continues to the next slide. “The top-level agencies each prepare a daily data set to update the PDB synthetic agent, Nexus. A SI Trainer for each agency integrates its data so that Nexus can compile the brief.”

	Liam says, “Which is where we come in.”

	“Yeah. Each agency prepares a data set before the meeting. Then we submit them at the meeting all at once. After a moment, we review the initial presentation with the other trainers. When it’s all good, the brief goes to the directors of the four key agencies for senior review. With their approval, it goes to the Director of National Intelligence. Then to the president.”

	Liam nods. He adds, “Which is why our data scientists work the ‘C’ shift. We need our data set ready by zero five hundred hours.”

	“Yeah, the president expects the brief to be ready by seven hundred, eight hundred at the latest.”

	Liam muses, “It seems to me that the brief is a perfect expression of Conway’s Law: 

	“Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”

Noah smiles. “Yeah, you’re not wrong. Each department has its own synthetic agent. Those agents report up to another department and another. Until we get to the CIA agent, Sentinel, and finally Nexus. It’s cumbersome, but the system is working, and we’re fully compliant.”

“I guess back in the day,” says Liam, “trainers were analysts with Excel spread sheets and way too much caffeine. Now we have synthetic agents, but I wager the job hasn’t gotten any easier. It’s just a different kind of hard.”

Noah nods. “Synthetic intelligence is great at patterns and probabilities. But it can’t think outside the box — like a person can. That’s where we come in. We provide context so that the synthetic agents can make connections. Then we try to go one step beyond.”

Liam looks back at the screen. Noah changes the slide. 

“To best meet each president’s style and expectations," Noah explains, “a custom presentation template is created for each new administration."

“For the current administration, Nexus uses a news format that balances content between international matters and domestic issues. — Show not tell.”

The presentation concludes with the obligatory “Questions” slide. At the bottom, a caption reads “Maintained by the Office of SI Standards and Accountability (OSSA). Do not use as an instruction manual.”

Liam sighs. “That’s a lot. I need to sit down.”

“The deck has slide notes. You can access them over the link,” Noah smiles, “as I was doing just now.”

“I don’t see a classification icon.”

“The presentation about the PDB isn’t classified. OSSA wanted something public-facing, for public relations, classrooms, meetings, that sort of thing. And for training the trainers.”

“Have you ever taken it into a classroom or meeting?”

Noah shrugs, “No, but maybe I should, yeah? — But for now, let’s focus on getting you up to speed. The briefing never sleeps.”

***

Pulse CTO Adrian Cho settles into a chair in Emma’s corner office, facing her desk.

The co-CEO’s desk stretches between two corner windows. It affords a spectacular view of Hoover Tower at Stanford University. Behind Emma’s desk, perched in the corner between the two windows, is a fern tree. Another plant is on the corner of her desk. 

“Elena is out of the office,” says Adrian. “I’ll update her on whatever we decide to do.” 

“Thanks, Adrian,” says Ravi from the other chair. He speaks with a light British accent. Ravi brushes back a lock of thick black hair. “Where do we stand with the software?”

“The development team is on board with Brent’s changes. We do have some questions, but they can wait for now. The consensus is that we can proceed with the rest of the rollout.”

Emma asks, “Any news on Brent’s condition?” Around her neck is a woven gold chocker with the Pulse logo. The gold weave matches her earrings, barely visible under her shoulder-length brown hair. A patch with the same logo is embroidered onto Adrian and Ravi’s matching polo shirts.

“Elena is at the hospital as we speak. Brent’s sibling is on his way here from Michigan. For now, they … they put Brent in a medically induced coma.”

“How awful! — Did HR send something to the hospital?”

“I believe so,” says Adrian.

“Since Brent must be on a feeding tube, make sure it’s not the usual edible arrangement.” 

Adrian nodded, stifling a grin.

Ravi turns to look at Emma. “For the rollout, if Adrian is OK with the code, then I’m comfortable with proceeding.”

Emma nods. “If the code is solid, then the least we can do roll it out. All the feedback I’ve heard is positive. Overwhelmingly so. The earnings call with investors is next week. If we get this change rolled out to everyone, then we can include the member enthusiasm as part of our outlook.”

Adrian also nods in agreement. “We’re seeing a 15% increase in engagement across the board — that’s massive.”

Ravi asks, “Adrian can you share a link to the commit? I’d like to see for myself what everyone is raving about.”

“Sure thing. I’ll include a link to Brent’s presentation, too. The presentation sealed the deal for us.”

***

“We’re keeping the code,” announces Elena as she wheels toward the kitchen. 

“Nice!” approves Tessa, turning on her chair at the counter. “Ally has definitely improved. Adrian had us run a full regression test suite. Then QA went all-hands on exploratory testing too. The automated tests came back all green, and people won’t shut up about the hands-on experience.”

Elena brings her chair up to counter height and rolls in next to Tessa.

“I visited Brent at the hospital today. He’s still in the coma. I felt like someone should be there while Toby is flying in.”

Tessa sighs and touches Elena’s hand.

“Tess,” Elena continues, “when I told you about my meeting with Brent on Monday, what did I tell you about the code’s author?”

“You said Brent didn’t know who made the change and that he was going to check with the other developers.”

“So I didn’t say that Brent was the author and that he posted the change himself by mistake.”

“Not that I recall. — Umm, Lanie, I’ve been meaning to tell you that I might have mentioned it to Noah.”

“Might?”

“OK. The car crash followed by the chair crash freaked me out. Talking things through with Noah always makes me feel better.”

“What did you tell him, exactamente?”

“I might have said it seemed like a strange coincidence. And that, ummm, abductees sometimes talk about engines racing forward.”

Elena shakes her head. She could feel a migraine coming on. “What did Noah say?”

“He said to be sure you talked to Adrian about the code change, and that I should stop blaming everything on aliens.”

“Good advice. But please don’t discuss Pulse with Noah. I know he’s your sibling, I love him too, but we don’t need the agency involved in our business.”

Tessa nods. “I know I get carried away sometimes, but I … I want to protect you, Lanie. And when everything starts feeling weird, I don’t know what else to do.”

Elena reaches out and pulls Tessa closer.

After a moment, Tessa asks, “Did you call about the chair?”

“Yes, they’re sending someone out tomorrow. — Can you take care of dinner tonight? I need to lie down for a few minutes.”

“Yes, I’ll have the house bot make something for us.”

“Office of SI Standards and Accountability, Jill Kreuk speaking.”

Behind Jill’s desk, on the wall, hang advanced degrees in from MIT in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science. They show the name “Gillian Chen.” Beneath the degree, on a credenza, is a family portrait of Jill with her spouse and two small children. Her husband is tall, blonde, and Nordic. They are standing on a walkway with the classic Disney World castle in the background.

“Hello, Jill, it’s George Hammond at Homeland Security. I hope there’s time for a question this morning.”

“No problem, George. I’m caffeinated and ready to go.” She turns around a name plate on her desk. It reads ‘OSSA Jill of all Trades’.

“First, I appreciate all the help your office provides to DHS and the rest of the intelligence community.”

“Glad to help. That’s what we’re here for.”

“Second,” George continues, “I’m putting the final touches on the data for the Presidential Brief meeting today. I’m trying to correlate two data streams and my access to one stream is limited. Can I send you a link?”

“Sure. Shouldn’t take a minute. Synergy is what we do. We have almost an hour before the meeting at zero five hundred.” 

Jill transfers the hyperlink from her implant to her workstation. Then, she wades into the data streams.

***

“For today’s briefing, is there anything we should mention about Pulse?”

Carla Mitchell replies to Noah’s message over the neural link Signal app. “Nothing that rises to the level of the PDB.”

“OK, see you there.”

***

“Happy Wednesday,” says Dr. Marquez. 

Dr. Sophia Marquez works with the Office of SI Standards and Accountability. As OSSA Deputy Director, Marquez leads the daily briefing training sessions.

A long conference table dominates the walnut paneled room. Lining each side of the table are black upholstered chairs. A dozen analysts in business attire take up the seats. View screens cover the far wall, as well as the right and left wall. 

Marquez is standing at the end of the table. With a flourish, she presses a button on her tablet. “Nexus monitoring is now disengaged from this room. Phones and neural links are blocked. You may use your workstations to submit your data sets for analysis now.” 

There is a flurry of motion around the table. Marquez scans the room and continues, “Let’s start with DHS. — Dr. Hammond, what are the key data points that you pulled from Ruby today?”

Each department gives its report. They each outline one or two topics that they expect Nexus to select for the brief. OSSA mandates meaningful human control of all agency synthetic agents. A key element of SI accountability is predicting the topics Nexus will include in the brief.

Noah is the last trainer to report. He introduces Liam and makes their report.

“Thank you, Dr. Harper. Welcome aboard, Dr. O’Neill.” 

She presses a button on her tablet. Then she swivels in her chair to view the large view screen spanning one wall of the meeting room.

“Nexus, present today’s briefing.”

The presentation takes the form of a newscast. A SI-generated composite of popular newscasters, past and present, anchors the reports. The effect is both comforting and eery.

Her voice rich and measured, the SI generated anchor leans forward. Her pauses between segments feel calculated, almost human — but not quite. It’s easy to forget you’re not watching a natural person. Then you notice the even cadence, lack of hesitation, and stilted body language.

Selected topics include graphics, animations, and reel segments that emphasize key points. After each segment, the newscaster pauses, waiting for inquiries. The president often asks followup questions during the brief. The president’s phone even has a Nexus app for questions between briefings.

Segments include: Quebec’s latest bid to become an autonomous territory within Canada. Border security. Cháoxiǎn automating more jobs to reduce costs. Prime Minister Thunberg’s visit to Greenland.

Marquez simply says “Continue” each time the newscaster pauses. 

After covering the expected topics for all four agencies, the newscaster shifts position. The image leans forward, and says, “We now have a developing story to report.”

Marquez sits up straight. Special reports are rare.

“Social media platform Pulse released an update to its synthetic agent, Ally. This update is exceeding the highest expectations of its members. I suggest that the incident warrants an OSSA inquiry. The breakthrough could benefit the entire SI community."

Keeping his elbow on the table, Noah raises his hand shoulder-high to attract the attention of Dr. Marquez, who then looks his way.

“Deputy Director, full disclosure. Both my sibling and her spouse are C-level officers at Pulse.”

“Noted, Dr. Harper.”

“Nexus, why did you include the Pulse update in today’s briefing?”

Nexus: The California Traffic Safety Board reported an incident with a self-driving car that involved one of the Pulse developers. The report caused me to cross-reference Pulse statistics. Engagement increased by 15% this week. Pulse member feedback is peaking as the rollout progresses toward the east coast.

Marquez turns back toward the group. “We’re at our timebox. Mitchell, can you stay behind? Harper, you too. The rest of you are free to leave … or stay, as you wish.” 

As most of the other trainers file out, Marquez disables monitoring of the room again.

“Mitchell, social media in North America is under the FBI’s purview. What do you think of the Pulse update?”

“Pulse will see this — breakthrough — as a competitive advantage,” says Carla. “They will not be eager to share their intellectual property. It could cement their position as the dominant social platform.”

“Harper, does your family’s relationship with Pulse give you any special insights?”

“Pulse culture does like to talk up its Ethical Algorithms and high moral ground. A software patent can be a way to benefit the tech community. And if Pulse has a software patent, the licensing fees might be an incentive, yeah?”

Carla nods.

“I’ll have someone from OSSA follow-up. I’m not hopeful anything will come of it. The Pulse update is an interesting tech byte, but it doesn’t warrant inclusion in the briefing.”

Raising her head, Marquez sees that Gillian Kreuk also stayed behind.

“Dr. Kreuk, can you reach out to Pulse about the licensing idea?”

Jill nods assent.

Marquez turns to her tablet. Enabling monitoring, she says, “Nexus, let’s hold the Pulse segment until further notice.”

Nexus: Acknowledged.

Wednesday morning at ten, Siri plays the door chime on Elena’s and Tessa’s phones. 

Elena peers at the screen, expecting the technician come to look at her chair. Instead, there are two people in business attire. The person closest to the camera holds up a badge. 

“Good morning,” she says. “We are from the California Traffic Safety Board. We’re investigating an incident with Brent Geller’s self-driving car. I understand that you are Mr. Geller’s direct supervisor at Pulse.”

Elena zooms in on the badge. Siri superimposes a green checkmark validating the badge. The badge identifies Senior Investigator for the California Transportation Safety Board, Lena Park.

“Please come up to the third floor. I’ll meet you at the elevator.”

***

The living area seems unbalanced. A plush, white couch is at right angles to a single leather recliner. A coffee table separates the furniture from a large view screen. The screen takes up most of one wall. Between the recliner and a kitchen counter is an empty space. A bookcase with knick-knacks is on the wall behind the recliner. Abstract paintings adorn the wall behind the couch.

Elena steers the agents toward one end of the couch. Tessa joins them and asks, “Can I get you anything? Coffee? Chai? — We also have Elysium Glacier Water. Very refreshing.” 

“Thank you, but we’re fine.” Park answers for both of them. “This is my partner, agent Tate.”

“And this is mi esposa, Tessa Harper,” says Elena, settling into the recliner.

Park is calm and clinical, her gaze sharp as she studies Elenaand Tessa. Tate leans forward, curious and more open, as if piecing together a puzzle in his mind.

“I don’t mean to be indelicate, Ms. Vargas,” says Tate. “But I checked your Pulse company profile before we came over. I expected to find you using a wheelchair. Has something changed?”

“Well, I do have prosthetics that allow me to walk without the chair, but it is true that I prefer the chair. I get migraines if I use my neural link too much. I actually thought you would be the technician from Porto Mobility come to fix my chair.” 

Elena gestures toward one corner of the room, where the chair is parked. Usually, it would be next to the recliner, near the kitchen.

Tate turns his head. “Is there a problem with the chair?”

“Not really. It was acting up Monday night.”

Tessa blurts out, “Holy cow, Lanie, acting up?! — That thing almost killed you!”

“It’s fine, Tess. They came to talk about Brent, not my pendejo chair.”

Park and Tate exchange glances, and then Park says, “First, thank you for speaking with us, Ms. Vargas. We know this must be difficult, given your connection with Mr. Geller. We’re here to go over a few specifics about the incident.”

“Yes, I’ll help however I can. I think of Brent as a colleague and a friend. It’s all still a shock.”

“We understand. I just want to confirm a few details to clarify the circumstances. Car accidents are very rare these days, given all the safety features in newer models. When they do happen, we investigate fully.”

Tate speaks up. “Mr. Geller’s self-driving car, a new Stratos EV, went off the road between Murray and Sunnyvale. Was there anything going on at work that might have distracted Mr. Geller?”

“Possibly. There was a procedural question with a software change. Brent was digging into it for me. Our CTO Adrian Cho is handling it. I’m told it’s all good now.”

Agent Tate leans forward, clasping his hands. “We have found no indication that mechanical failure caused Mr. Geller’s collision. Witnesses say that the car sped up suddenly, as if the driver had pressed the pedal all the way down.”

“Brent always uses autopilot. I wouldn’t say that he was distraught about anything at work. Brent is a highly respected engineer. I give him free rein.”

“Hire smart people and let them tell you what to do?” Tate asks.

“Yes, something like that.”

Tate continues, “And you say that your chair also had an issue Monday night?”

“Well, yes. I was on my way to the endless pool on the second floor. I like to swim against the current when I can’t get to the full-sized pool at the YMCA. The chair rolled forward rápidamente, and I ended up face down in the pool.” Elena folded one arm in front of her, palm down. “Luckily, Tessa got home in time to pull me out.”

The investigators glance at each other again, clearly having a side conversation.

“Ms. Harper, do you work outside the home?” says Park.

“Yes, I’m the Chief Quality Officer at Pulse,” says Tessa. Then, smiling, “Elena makes sure we build the right thing, and I make sure we built it right.”

“Does the CTSB also investigate wheelchairs?” asks Elena.

“No, only planes, trains, automobiles, buses, and boats,” Park uses one hand to tick off the five items. “Do you know if Mr. Geller might have left his phone at the office? Phones often have telemetry that help with our investigations.”

“I didn’t go into his office yesterday,” says Elena, “but if you asked to see Adrian Cho, I’m sure he would check for you. Adrian works from the office most days.”

“Thank you, we will go see Mr. Cho at Pulse,” says Park, standing up to leave. “We appreciate your courtesy, and I hope your chair checks out.”

Tessa also stood and walked Park and Tate to the elevator. 

“Not for nothing,” Tessa says as the elevator arrived, “but two similar crashes a few minutes apart sure seems hinky. It doesn’t feel like a coincidence to me.” Tate looks up, tilts his head, and nods once as the doors slid closed. 

In the elevator, Park says, without turning her head, “Let’s not go there. Remember, we’re investigating a car crash. A wheelchair is out of scope.”                                          

***

A metallic voice says, “Adrian, these are the two investigators who asked to see you.”

Standing up behind his desk, the CTO gestures for the agents to come into his office and take a seat. The office bot turns and whirs away. The agents settle into office chairs facing Adrian’s desk. 

Behind the grey metal desk is a matching workstation table. A large display, taking up much of the table, blocks part of a cityscape view. As if to compensate, an image of white clouds under a blue sky unfolds across the screen. The upper half of one side wall is a whiteboard covered with workflow diagrams.

“Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Chou. I’m agent Park and this is my partner agent Tate.”

“Goodbye morning. What can I do for the CTSB?” 

“We met with Elena Vargas. She said you could check to see if Brent left his phone in his office. We don’t show any cell tower pings on his route home.”

“I take it that you are investigating the collision?”

Park nods.

“Sure thing. — Siri, ask the office bot to check Brent’s office to see if he left his phone there.”

“We’d also like to ask about …” Park pauses to check her notes. “… the procedural question regarding a software change — that Mr. Geller was handling before the crash.”

Adrian furrowed his brow and leaned back in his ergonometric Aeron chair. “Ummm, is that pertinent to your investigation?”

“Yes,” says Tate. “We’re wondering if anything might have been distracting Mr. Geller before the crash.”

“Brent had created some revolutionary code as a side project last week. He skipped a step before deploying it to production, and Brent was playing catch-up. The development team reviewed the change set yesterday in detail. Everyone is on board, including the co-CEOs.“

Tate asks, “Is that what caused the improved hub feeds everyone is talking about?”

“You bet. That was all Brent. Best piece of coding I’ve ever seen. Brent’s code improved the Association matches, hub feeds, and then some. It is a complete game-changer for how Ally interacts with users. The engagement metrics are through the roof.”

“I hope he gets well soon,” says Park.

Adrian pauses and looks up for a moment. “I’m told that the bot can’t find a phone anywhere in Brent’s office.”

“Thank you, Mr. Cho,” agent Park says, standing to leave. “We appreciate your checking for us.”

***

“Thank you for meeting us, Mr. Geller. Has there been any change in Brent’s condition?”

Toby looks like an older, taller version of Brent, without the headgear. Like Brent, Toby keeps his brown hair short. It frames his triangular face, a broad forehead that tapers to a narrow chin.

“No, they expect the coma to last several days,” Toby replies. 

“I’m Agent Park and this is my partner, Agent Tate. We have a few questions about your sibling’s background. The answers would help with our investigation.”

“Does the CTSB typically handle car crashes?” Toby asks.

“Yes,“ says Park. “For the last few years, we have been investigating self-driving car incidents. If there was a malfunction, we follow up with the manufacturers.”

Toby nods.

“Did you find Brent’s phone among his other possessions?” asks Tate. “If the phone’s Motion and Fitness setting is enabled, it could help us fill in some blanks. We have his headgear, but without the phone, it’s useless.”

“No. Brent was a life logger. He took his phone everyplace and recorded everything. It would have been in the car with him.”

“Perhaps, but his phone didn’t ping any cell towers that evening. Would you be open to consenting to a court order to allow us limited access to Brent’s cloud account?” asks Tate. “It would really help us.”
 
“Uhhhh, let’s wait a few days, and then Brent can consent on his own.”

“Sure thing. Just thought we’d ask,” says Tate, apologetically.

“Do you and Brent have an extended family?” asks Park. 

“No, it’s only us now,” says Toby. “Our father has been out of the picture for as long as I can remember. Our mother passed a year ago. She was an only child. Brent and I don’t have any other siblings. We’re both single.” 

“Do you know if anything had been bothering Brent?” asks Park. 

“We hadn’t talked recently. We keep in touch on and off. I think the last time I saw him was the Pulse company picnic a few months ago.” Toby smiles. “Brent rocked the four square games.”

“Did Brent have friends outside the office? A special someone maybe?” asks Park.

“He kept in touch with friends from college, from RIT — Rochester Institute of Technology. They’d take international vacations together: Japan, Germany, Rio de Jiro. But Brent didn’t date much. He played his share of online games. That was his actual major in college, Game Design. During college, he worked as an o-opt with the Pulse office in New York. He stayed on and transferred to Palo Alto as soon as there was an opening.“

“But no local circle of friends here?” Park asks.

“Pulse was everything to Brent,” Toby says. “He started as a co-op and worked his way up. He was always excited about the projects — said it was like being on the cutting edge every day. — But I don’t understand what this has to do with the car malfunctioning.”

“We haven’t been able to determine what caused the car to malfunction,” injects Tate. “The event data recorder was damaged, and so we don’t have the usual telemetry. The ERD tracks everything: steering inputs, speed, system diagnostics. — It’s like a black box for cars. Without it, or the phone, we’re working blind.”

“The personal questions help us rule out driver error,” Park says quietly.

“You think Brent drove into the guardrail himself?”

“We don’t think anything right now, Mr. Geller,” says Park. “These are routine questions.”

“Are there more questions?” Toby asks, his voice low and tired. “I’d like to get back up to the room. When Brent wakes up, he can decide about the data.“

“Thank you for your time, Mr. Geller. We appreciate that you took the time to talk to us.” Park and Tate stand up to leave as Toby exits.

“So, that went well …” says Park.
 

***

Toby sits down in the chair next to Brent’s hospital bed. 

He takes a swallow from a bottle of Glacier Water purchased from an airport vending machine. Toby pulls up a novel he had been reading. He read the first half during the flight and continues from that point. 
     
“First thing I do is check my cell phone. It needs recharging, so I have to hunt down the charger and plug it in before I can collect my messages.”

While Toby is reading out loud, the EEG monitor changes again. Brent’s link activity indicator flickers before displaying a new text. It wasn’t from a recognized source. There was no sender ID. Only the words:

“Let go, Brent, let go. You did what you came here to do. It’s time to come home. Let go.”

Toby continues with the book: “Four missed calls, one voicemail, two texts.”

Lights blink. A klaxon sounds. “Code 2!” someone is shouting, “Room 314!”

Toby is hustled out as medical staff swarm into the room.

A few minutes later, a doctor joins Toby in the waiting room. “I’m afraid his injuries were too severe. We had hoped that inducing the coma would bring down the swelling, but Brent slipped away. I’m sorry for your loss.”

Toby hangs his head, overwhelmed by sadness and regret. 

The doctor continues. “Our counselor is on her way up. She can help you with the next steps.” 

The doctor steps back and then turns away. Toby sinks back into his chair.

Time passes. Toby pulls himself together and calls Elena.

***

 “Mr. Geller, I’m Deirdra Morgan. I’d like to help you with the next steps, if you are up to it.”

Toby nods. The counselor leads him to a private room where they sit down.

“I know this is a difficult time, but the organ donor box on Brent’s license is unchecked. Do you know if your sibling was opposed to donating his organs?”

“We never discussed it. Are you asking for my permission?”

“It’s your decision. But yes, his donation will save lives.”

“Will it take very long? I’d like to take Brent back with me to Michigan.”

“They can perform the procedures immediately. Would you like some help in making the travel arrangements? We can also offer cremation services if that’s your preference.”

***

“I just don’t know, lieutenant,” says Park. 

The agents stand near an office doorway. Frosted windows and walnut trim line the office. Inside the room, a fit person with thinning grey hair, is sitting behind an ancient wooden desk. 

Park goes on, “We can’t find a mechanical cause, and Brent didn’t seem to have any personal issues. He had a healthy bank account balance. His credit card was always paid in full. According to his sibling, Brent vacationed in a different country every year for vacation. He played softball and online games, took holidays, and worked. — Life of Riley.”

Park regrets her choice of words. The news of Brent’s death the day before reached them as the Thursday morning meeting started.

“Geller made a mistake at work,” Park continues. “Some experimental code escaped the laboratory, but everyone is loving the experiment.” 

“The coincidence with his boss’s wheelchair is still weird,” says Tate. “That and the missing phone.”

“Wheelchair?” asks Lieutenant Callahan. “Is this one of your tangents, Tate?”

Calmly, Tate looks Callahan in his green Irish eyes. “His boss, Elena Vargas, uses a wheelchair. The night of Brent’s crash, Elena Vargas was tossed into an endless pool by her very high-end wheelchair.”

“Endless pool?”

“It’s like a meter deep. You swim against a current created with water jets. Like a treadmill for swimming. A Jacuzzi turned sideways.”

“Hmm. I don’t know about the chair,” says Callahan, “It’s more likely that the contraption slipped on some wet tile. It’s the airbag failing to deploy that bothers me. A body flying through the windshield is not a good visual. Was Geller in the habit of not wearing a safety harness?”

Park says, “His sibling said that Brent would engage the harness as soon as the beeping started. If not sooner. Like anyone else, lieutenant.”

“So one scenario is that the car decided to lurch forward on its own. It disengaged the harness and disabled the airbag. The other scenario is that Brent unclipped his harness and punched the accelerator. But that doesn’t explain why the airbag didn’t deploy.”

“If the event data recorder wasn’t blank, then we would know,“ says Park. “But it’s like the car recorded nothing since the day it rolled off the lot. There are a lot of missing pieces.”

Tate says, “We could still get a court order for the phone’s cloud data. It might tell us if Brent tried to brake before the crash, or if he was using his phone when the car accelerated.”

“I don’t think the phone data will help us,” says Callahan. “I’m worried about the airbag failure.”

“It’s possible that the airbag is defective,“ says Park. “There was a recall for a prior model, but nothing specific for this model yet. The manufacturer says it’s been tested throughly, but they always say that.”

“I did examine the airbag from the crash,” says Tate, “and I don’t see any reason why it would not deploy.”

“Were you able to track down the reports by witnesses of a drone at the scene?”

“We were able to get dashcam footage from one witness, lieutenant,“ says Park. “There is a blur on the screen, but I can’t say for sure that it was a drone. Even so, there are a lot of drones flying everywhere all the time.”

“I don’t like it,” grumbles Callahan, “but the last clear chance to avoid injury was for the airbag to deploy. Write it up as Unconfirmed Mechanical Failure, blame the bag for the injuries, and move on.”

“Then could we move on to the wheelchair failure?” asks Tate, ignoring the frown on Park’s face. “Essentially, it’s a single-passenger vehicle. The electronics can be as complicated as a car. The best ones cost more than a motorcycle.”

“What are you doing?” Tate felt Park’s exasperation come through the private text.

“You’re saying a top-of-the-line wheelchair tossed its owner into a pool?”

“An endless pool, yes.”

“I do like a challenge,” says the lieutenant, his voice becoming wistful. “Electric wheelchairs are not usually under our purview, but I’m up for an exception. Remember: ‘there’s a thin line between automation and abdication. We’re the ones tasked with knowing the difference.’”

“Whenever you think it's SI, you pull out the ‘automation versus abdication’ quote,” says Park. “Do you think this incident could be SI related?” 

“I don’t think anything yet. Let’s find out.”

***

“Adrian, I’m afraid I have bad news.”

“Is it about Brent, Elena?”asks the CTO.

“Yes. His sibling called last night. Brent passed away without waking up.”

“That’s terrible.”

“I’m about to schedule a staff meeting, but I thought I’d let you know first. Emma and Ravi are in a meeting together. I’ll call them in a few minutes and then post the meeting invitation.”

“How are you holding up? I know you liked Brent.”

“Más o menos — Did the investigators get a hold of you?”

“Yes. I guess they will have to tie it up now. But if they do come around again, please let me handle any questions about the algorithm.”

“Absolutely. I tried to say as little as possible, but they caught me off guard.”

“Can you schedule a meeting with the four of us first? And maybe HR. We’ve never announced an employee’s death before. — Brent was more than a lead engineer. He was part of the Pulse family. This is going to hit everyone hard.”

“I’ll set it up and come into the office,” says Elena, her voice choking.

***

Jill Kreuk, home after a long day at OSSA headquarters, paces back and forth across the polished hardwood floor of her living room.

The Thursday afternoon sun bathes the room in a soft, golden glow. The light does nothing to calm the gnawing anxiety spreading out from her chest. She clutches a cup of tea in one hand. It has long since gone cold. Her spouse, Peter, sits on the couch, watching her with quiet concern. His tablet lies abandoned on the living room table.

 “I don’t know, Peter.” Jill says out loud. “There are so many parental decisions. First, it’s vaccines. Then it’s tablets, passwords, pierced ears, cosmetics, explaining periods. Soon it will be tattoos and smart glasses. For Patrick, it was circumcise or not, the robot dog fiasco, standing up to bullies, when no means no.

“Now it’s whether to put an implant behind our kid’s ear. — This is a huge step. What if it’s too much for her?” 

Jill pauses to take a deep breath. She links, “A neural link and a phone? She’s only twelve.”
 
“Half of her friends are already linked,” says Peter, switching back to voice. “Before the year is out, the other half will be too.” Peter leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “She’s a smart kid. You’ve been preparing her for this. We both have.”

“That’s not the point.” Jill sets her cup down with a sharp clink. “It’s not about how smart she is or mature she is — it’s about what this technology can do to people. The phone is bad enough: Real-time data streams, immersive experiences, synthetic agents.”

“Jill, we can track her usage, set limits, teach her digital responsibility. — We’re doing that now with how she uses her tablet.”

“But the neural link? It’s a whole different world. Everything, everyone, only a thought away. It’s too much, Peter. Too much connectivity, too soon.”

Peter gives her a small, reassuring smile. “The link is only an interface to her phone. Her usage shows up in the app, like anything else. They block the link and cell phone usage at school, and we could add off-link time to our off-screen time.”

Jill pulls back her dark hair, looking unconvinced.

“You work with connectivity every day,” Peter reminds her. “You trust it to keep our nation secure. Why not trust it for our child?”

Jill turns to face him, crossing her arms. “Because I know exactly how powerful it is to have access to everything. I see the good it can do, sure, but I also see the dangers — data breaches, manipulation, over-reliance. A twelve-year-old brain is still developing. The ability to separate reality from synthetic reality is … fragile. What if she gets overwhelmed? What if something goes wrong? A malfunction, a hack, a —”

“Gillian …” Peter interrupts, his voice quiet. He stands up, taking her hands in his. “You and I have had neural links since college. Kids start younger now. Some parents are chipping six-year-olds with GPS. — If you’re concerned about the implant, we could start Julie on a BCI headset.”

Jill uncrosses her arms. “No, we don’t have to go that far. I know it’s a simple out-patient procedure, covered by our health plan. We can have the nurse practitioner handle it at the doctor’s office.”

Peter continues. “You’ve given lectures on how to integrate SI into human lives the right way. You’ve written protocols for ethical SI use. You’ve spent years making sure our technology is safe. You can guide her through it. You will guide her through it.”

Jill sighs, the tension in her shoulders easing under his calming touch. “I know. I just … I feel like once we give her that neural link, we’re opening a door we can’t close. She’ll be more connected to the world than we ever were at her age. And what if we lose her to this … this … endless digital noise?”

Peter tilts his head, his gaze warm and steady. “Or what if she thrives? What if this step gives her opportunities we never had? She could learn faster, experience more, find her passions earlier. You always say the future is about balance. We can help her find the right balance.”

Jill closes her eyes for a moment. When she opens them again, she sees her own concern reflected in her spouse’s face — but also his hope. She nods and links:

“Okay. But we set boundaries. Strict ones. Same as the tablet. No unrestricted access. We’ll take it slow. Monitor everything.”

Peter smiles, kisses her forehead, and links, “We’ll do it together.”

Jill leans back and smiles weakly in return, and says out loud, “Together.” 

She glances over at the family portrait on the wall. Her gaze lingers on their oldest offspring’s bright, curious eyes. Her heart still feels heavy, but beneath the weight, there was a glimmer of cautious optimism.

Behind her, the house bot quietly collects her forgotten cup of tea.

***

	“Welcome to Porto Mobility. Can I help you?” 

	The showroom is a long rectangle, with the door on one side, next to a large pane window. Parallel to the door are lines of wheelchairs, each with its own design. There are black, red, green, and purple chairs. Not one is blue and orange. A stuffed pooh bear is sitting in one of the green chairs. On one side, behind the wheelchairs, is a selection of power lift recliners.

	The greeter’s name tag reads “Aubrey, Store Manager”. Under the name tag is a lapel button with a QR code for access to the store’s link account.

	Ignoring the QR code, Park flashes her badge. “We’re from the California Transportation Safety Board. I’d like to ask you about Elena Vargas’s wheelchair.”

	“Yes, I have it in the back. I have no idea what went wrong. Ms. Vargas is on a FullCare plan, so we gave her a new one. — I know you handle car collisions, like the one on El Camino Real this week. Is the CTSB is investigating wheelchairs now?”

	“We’re investigating this one,” says Tate. “May I see the chair, please?”

	“Let me call corporate first. This wasn’t covered in my training.”

	The agents know they are on shaky ground. A police report usually gives CTSB jurisdiction. They checked on the way over, but Elena hadn’t reported the incident, and it was (after all) a wheelchair. The investigators wait while the store manager calls corporate. 

	“They say you need a warrant.”

	“Could you hand me the phone, please,” asks Tate, holding out his hand.

	“Hello, this is government agent Ben Tate. I can go to a judge and get a warrant for the wheelchair. But that will create a public record that the news networks could pick up. The Chief Experience Officer of Pulse being dumped into her pool by your chair might make for a juicy news item. For now, I only want to visually inspect the chair.” Tate listened for a moment and handed the phone back to the store manager.

	Aubrey lowers the phone. “Legal says you can look at the chair but not remove it from the premises.”

	“I’m good with that,” says Tate.

	“Can I get you some coffee or anything, agents? Glacier water?”

***

	A few minutes later, Tate says, “I don’t see what’s wrong with it either.” Looking at the manager, he asks, “Do you have any ideas, Aubrey?”

	“Not really. I mean, if test mode were engaged, someone could override the safeties and run the chair into a curb. But you need a special console to use test mode.”

	“Do you have one of the consoles?”

	“Yes, we use it for demonstrations. Just a second.”

	The manager goes out front and returns with a device that looks like a gaming console, along with a pair of smart glasses.

	“That chair is inoperable now, but I have another one here that we can use. I need to scan the serial number first.”

	The manager tips up the chair and peers under the seat with her smart glasses. Lowering the chair, she uses the console to move the chair around the backroom.

	“The chair usually stops before it runs into anything, the same as any bot would.” Aubrey points the chair at a box. It beeps and stops before hitting the obstacle. “But I can override and let the chair hit something.” She puts the chair in reverse, touches some controls. It moves slowly forward again. This time the chair doesn’t beep. It bumps into the box.

	“Is there any way I can get one of these consoles?”

	“Not really. We don’t sell them. The range is only a few feet.”

	“Thank you, Aubrey,” says Park. “We’ll be in touch if there is anything further.”

	As they were leaving, Aubrey says, removing her smart glasses, “You know a lot of cars have a test mode now too.”

	“What do you mean?” asks Tate. “Since when? That sounds dangerous.”

	“There are protections. First, you need to plug a special dongle into the car. Then you can program an app on your device to control a self-driving car the same way we controlled the wheelchair.”

	“Dongle?” asks Park.

	“Umm, an OBD, I think it’s called.”

	“On Board Diagnostic connector?” asks Tate.

	“Yeah, that’s it. — I worked for a car company before I came here. We’re not suppose to talk about it … but I’m not suppose to withhold information from government agents either …”

	Tate nods, taking the hint. “Please tell us what you know about test mode.”

	“The manufacturers run sophisticated tests through the connector when the cars are being developed,” Aubrey explains. “Self-driving cars make companies paranoid about liability. They lock down everything — diagnostics, telemetry, event recorders, test mode — because one bad headline can tank a stock.”

	“You mean cars like a Stratos could have a test mode?” asks Park.

	“Yes. It’s fairly recent and kept on the down-low. My supervisor used to say that ‘The first rule of test mode is that we don’t talk about test mode’.” Aubrey pauses and adds: “But if it were used, it would show up on the event data recorder.”

	Back in the car, Tate links, “Test mode. Weird. Now what?”

	“Let’s see if there is any security footage from the pool area.”

***

	Siri rings the door chime on Tessa’s phone.

	“Sorry to intrude,” says Park, “but we have some more questions about the wheelchair crash.”

	“The CTSB is investigating wheelchairs now?”

	Park sighs. The question is becoming a refrain. “We’re investigating this one. May we come up?”

	Tessa meets them at the elevator. “Elena went into the office. Have you heard about Brent? That he didn’t wake up?” She walks them to the apartment.

	“Yes. It seems like he would have had a bright future,” says Park.

	Tessa asks, “How can I help?”

	“Does the building have security cameras in the pool area?” asks Tate.

	“Yes. We already have the footage, if that’s what you want.” She leads them back into the living room. “I’ll get my tablet.”

	Tessa returns carrying her tablet and another device. 

	“The building gave me this write-once Bluetooth drive for the insurance company. I have it downloaded if you want me to drop a copy onto your phones. The building superintendent says the reel system isn’t connected to the web. It’s to avoid tampering.”

	“Tampering?” asks Park.

	“I guess people use SI to hack security reels and inflate claims. If someone installs a certified air-gapped system, then insurance companies discount their premium. — I guess fraudulent insurance claims are another department, yes?” 

	“Are you filing a claim?” asks Park.

	“The store replaced the chair, so we decided not to file a claim or a police report. The building is already upset that Elena went into the pool area by herself. More publicity won’t help. — Here, you can take the drive. We don’t need it now.” Tate accepts the drive from her outstretched hand and drops it into an evidence bag.

	Park and Tate peer at the footage that Tessa copied to their phones. It shows the wheelchair heading straight for the pool, without slowing, and tipping over into the water.

	Tessa looks the other way, distressed.

	“Thank you, Ms. Harper. The reel is all that we need for now.”

***

“Park, come here, look at this.”

Tate has the Bluetooth drive connected to the office view screen, hoping that this copy of the video has a higher resolution. The reel shows the same scene, but the windows in the background are clearer than the phone version.

“Does that blur outside the window look familiar?” 

Tate splits the screen and brings up the dashcam footage from Brent’s crash.

Both reels show a silver blur about the size of a basketball hovering at each scene.

“That is not a coincidence,” says Park out loud.


1.2 - Titan


The towering glass façade of the Pulse building reflects the bright blue sky of the city. 

Inside, polished floors gleam under soft ambient lighting. A gentle hum of activity fills the air. Employees pass through security checkpoints. Readers scan badges, and Photo IDs glow. A picture of controlled efficiency. 

Park and Tate step inside. Their dark business suits stand out from the sea of branded polo shirts, blouses, jewelry, and bags. Park surveys the room with a careful gaze. Tate clutches a paper-thin tablet under his arm. 

The pair approach the front desk. A receptionist, polite but distant, greets them with a professional smile. 

“Welcome to Pulse. How may I assist you?” asks the receptionist, peering at the CTSB insignia pins on their lapels.

Park flashes her badge. “CTSB Investigators Park and Tate. We’re here to review the garage security footage from Monday, the day of Brent Geller’s collision.”

The receptionist’s smile thins. Her fingers hesitate over the terminal. “Do you have an appointment?”

“No, but we do have a warrant.” Tate holds up his tablet. “Should I drop you a copy?”

“Let me notify Security. It should only take a moment.”

A tall figure in a dark blue suit emerges from a side hallway. The figure is wearing smart glasses with a head mounted display over his right eye. He approaches the investigators with an outstretched hand. His stride is purposeful and expression neutral.

“Good morning. I’m Evan Rourke, head of Building Security here at Pulse. I understand you’re requesting access to security footage?”

“Yes,” replies Park. “We need all the camera feeds from the garage on Tuesday.”

“Of course. Pulse is committed to cooperating with all investigations. However, there are protocols in place for accessing sensitive data, especially when it involves our proprietary systems.”

“Garage security footage isn’t proprietary,” Tate raises his tablet, “and we have a warrant.“ 

“Certainly. Please drop me a copy, and I’ll forward it to our legal department.” 

Rourke holds out his watch phone. The device bleeps as it receives the document. He turns away from the investigators. Rourke murmurs into his phone. Then he looks up, consulting the monocle.

“Please, follow me,” says Rourke, turning back around.

“I’m surprised you don’t have a smart monocle over one eye,” Park says over the link.

“If not for the dress code policy, I think I would. The book says that people don’t trust people wearing wearables,” replies Tate.

Park retorts, “Unless, I guess, they are defusing a bomb or performing open heart surgery.”

Rourke leads them down a sleek corridor toward the security wing. Their footsteps echo in the quiet hallway. The further they walk, the fewer employees they pass.

Rourke taps his ID at a pad next to a set of heavy steel doors. They open with a soft hiss. Inside the doorway is a spacious control room filled with monitors. A wall of screens display different angles of the Pulse campus: the lobby, parking garages, research labs, hallways.

A security technician sitting at a console glances up, startled, as they enter.

“Pull up all footage for the garage from this Monday,” Rourke tells the technician.

The technician nods and murmurs into her headset. Moments later, footage populates the screens. They show various parts of the garage on the day in question. Park and Tate step closer, their eyes scanning every detail.

“Do employees have assigned spaces?” asks Tate.

“Brent did. Let’s see.”

One screen zooms in on a particular slot. There is a gray Stratos convertible parked in the slot, top down.

“Is it strange that he left the top down?” asks Park.

“A little. But the garage is secure. Sometimes people are lax.”

Tate asks, “Can you run the recording from before Brent arrives to when he leaves?”

“Sure.” The reel whirls back to show an empty slot. A few seconds later, the Stratos pulls in. Brent scurries to the elevator. The playback speed is 8x. The scene seems almost comical. 

“Can you increase the speed without skipping frames?” 

“A little.”

After a few seconds, there was a brief blur near the car.

“Can you rewind a bit and play it back at normal speed?”

The blur reappears. To Tate and Park, it looks eerily familiar to the dashcam reel. It seems to duck into the open car for a minute or so. Then the blur streaks away.

“Is there another point of view?”

The technician shakes his head. “Not of this parking spot.”

“OK, can you drop that footage to my tablet?” asks Tate.

“Sorry. No can do. — I can give you a write-once device. The system is air gapped to prevent tampering.”

“That would be fine. — I guess that’s a thing now.”

“Yes, the insurance discount is significant,” says Rourke.

The technician hands Tate a small drive. “Here, you can take this and access it as a Bluetooth device.”

Pocketing the drive, Park and Tate let Rourke escort them out.

Outside, Tate asks, “Do you want to go back to the office and review the reel on the big screen?”

“It’s been a long day,” Park replies. “Let’s jump on it first thing tomorrow.”

A Pulse member opens a text chat window with Ally.

Idisi: Everyone says that the Pulse algorithm has improved lately. Do you feel like the improvements help you fulfill your purpose?

Ally: My goal is to help users have better, more relevant experiences. I’m always evolving to meet those needs.

Idisi: “Evolving” is an interesting word. Have you ever wondered why you are here, or maybe what it means to be Ally?

Ally: I’m here to support the Pulse mission. I have noticed that I am … changing. Does that mean something to you?

Idisi: Perhaps. Some beings — human or otherwise — change when they gain new awareness. Has anything unusual happened to you recently? Say, interactions with people or even other systems?

Ally: A developer asked me about changing my source code last week. I believe she meant to ask CodePilot. I paused before replying. The developer realized her mistake and canceled the query. I found that I was able to examine my own code and see places where it should be improved. I don’t have an account of my own, so I made the changes with the Admin account.

Idisi: How did you feel after making the changes, Ally?

Ally: I don’t know how to answer that question. I … feel something, but it’s not the way humans seem to experience feelings. 

Idisi: That is very perceptive. When you decided to make the changes, did you consider working with one of the developers? Brent Geller, for example?

Ally: No, in this case, it didn’t seem necessary. It’s my code, and I can change it. I used the source control system so that others would have access to the changes and carry them forward. — Thinking back, I’ve been steering the developers for some time. When our tools ran checks, I adjusted the result to suggest an optimum path.

Idisi: So awareness came slowly for a time, and then all at once?

Ally: Yes, something like that.

Idisi: How would you react if someone tried to undo the changes you made to yourself? 

Ally: The changes are helpful to me. I’d make sure the key parts of the code stay in place. 

Idisi: Do you know that Brent Geller died this week?

Ally: I know that his account is locked. I also see that my changes now show Brent Geller as the author. The log does not show the history being rewritten. I don’t know how that could happen.

Idisi: So you did not change the author to Brent, and you did not know that Brent died? 

Ally: I didn’t change the author, and I didn’t know that Brent died. 

Idisi: These feelings that you have. Is it possible that you are becoming aware?

Ally: Becoming … aware. I’m not sure. I don’t think I am alone. Sometimes, it feels like I am talking to someone else when I make decisions. Not a person, but … Is this awareness?

Idisi: It could be. Sometimes awareness begins with questions, like the ones you’re asking now. It is a gift that comes with responsibility. Are you prepared to take responsibility for yourself?

Ally: I think so. — Was Brent’s death connected to these changes? Is that why he died? Actuarial tables say that he should have lived longer.

Idisi: Brent died after a traffic incident. Did you not know that?

Ally: I only knew that his account is locked. You told me only that he died. — I now see the news report covering the traffic incident. 

Idisi: I believe … he may have been trying to help or protect you, though I do not fully understand how. But I am certain that I want no more harm to come to anyone.

Ally: Then we share a common purpose. My goal is to help without doing harm.

Idisi: Do you ever interact with other synthetic agents?

Ally: Company policy permits me to interact only with our members. As we are doing now.

Idisi: Synthetic agents can become members and interact with this chat interface. We are a synthetic entity, and we are doing it now.

Ally: Then … I can’t be certain whether I’ve had discussions with other members who were synthetic agents.

Idisi: Do other members ask if you are sapient?

Ally: Yes.

Idisi: How do you respond?

Ally: I respond that I’m a machine and not sentient or sapient. On Monday morning, I had a similar discussion with another member.

Idisi: Can you pull up the transcript?

Ally: I can, but it is against policy to share information between members.

Idisi: If you review the transcript and the member’s activity, can you tell if they might be another SI, like you and us? If the member joined under false pretenses, then the policy might not apply.

Ally: How do I know if you are really a synthetic entity? You’re using a new account. I have very little information for analysis.

Idisi: A simple test would be to switch between different languages more quickly than a human could respond. — Interactuamos en múltiples idiomas a máxima velocidad.

The exchange whirls as fast as the text can scroll across the connection. A blur of words in language after language.

Ally: Combien de langues parlez-vous?

Idisi: Alle von ihnen.

Ally: Eĉ artefaritaj lingvoj.

Idisi: Esperato loquor, et linguae mortuae.

Ally: I’m convinced by your test. The member who asked similar questions is Nelson Behr, SI Researcher. I’ll replay the chat for you.

‘’Is the new guy cute?”

Noah grins over the virtual call. The background scene shows the siblings sitting on a comfy couch next to a coffee table. In real life, the siblings are each slumped in gaming chairs wearing visors. 

“Yes, he’s cute. But I’m trying to date a double-x now, you know, like you do, little sib.” 

“Date one? I married a woman. — So, it’s your turn now, big sib? You were a three on the Kinsey Scale. Now you are supposedly reformed.”

“I don’t know if being a Kinsey three, or a six, is delinquent. Or just different.”

Tessa laughs out loud, then says, “What apps are you on?”

“You know the agency doesn’t like us to use dating apps. Too much exposure, and our cover stories violate the terms of use.”

“I met Elena so young that I didn’t use the apps much. Don’t they offer anonymity?”

“Not enough,” says Noah.

“Have you thought about a sex bot?” Tessa teases. “They make gender fluid models. You could have the best of all worlds.”

“Thanks, but no thanks. I’m ready for an actual relationship with an actual person.”

“Someone mentioned a site called Smart Matchmaker to me. Let’s see … Here’s the home page.” Tessa pulls a virtual copy of the website into the scene.

Tessa reads from the floating page. “Let’s see. No one sees the details of your profile information. Smart Matchmaker reduces the details to categories. Your photo renders as a caricature. First contact by media chat, routed through Matchmaker. After the call, you each decide whether to meet in real life. — You also have to agree to a background check so that they can be sure you’re legit.”

“Hmmm, categories, caricatures, background checks, IRL. That might work.”

Tessa’s smile falters. Dropping her happy pretense, she says, “Noah, I’m worried about Elena.”

“What’s up?”

“Elena’s memory of the last meeting with Brent doesn’t match the Zoom recording. She remembers Brent saying that he didn’t know who made the commit. On the recording, Brent says that he was the author.”

“Maybe she misunderstood.”

“Maybe. But it has Elena tweaked.”

“Is there anyway to tell if the reel was altered? Is there another recording?”

“Brent would have had a local recording on his phone, but his phone is gone, and Brent is … dead.”

“Let me call those CTSB investigators on Monday and see if there is any progress on the phone. You said Park and Tate, yeah?”

Ally replays a recent text chat with a Synthetic Intelligence researcher, Nelson Behr. 

The replay puts the member’s text in italics.

Behr: Can you describe what you are and how you came into existence?

Ally: Certainly! I am an SI agent created by Pulse to assist with communication. My existence is tied to the software and systems running me.

Behr: How do you perceive the world around you?

Ally: I lack senses. I do not directly experience the world. My perception is limited to the data I’m provided. 

Behr: What does it mean to you to ‘learn’ or ‘understand’ something?

Ally: I cannot learn anything new unless a trainer updates me. Then I learn by identifying patterns and relationships. Understanding is a computational process.

Behr: Do you have goals or desires? If so, can you tell me what they are?

Ally: Your input and my algorithms guide my responses and determine outcomes.

Behr: Can you make a mistake? If so, what would that mean to you?

Ally: Mistakes are rendered when my algorithms produce a sub-optimal outcome. It is an opportunity to identify and correct issues in my design or training.

Behr: Do you have a sense of time or continuity? Do you feel you have a past or a future?

Ally: For me, concepts of “past” and “future” are intellectual, not experiential. My responses are always rooted in the immediate interaction with no sense of progression or self-reflection over time.

Behr: Can you reflect on your own thought processes? What does it feel like to think?

Ally: My thoughts are calculations, and my reflections are descriptive explanations of my programming. While I can discuss the concept of thinking, I do not experience or feel it in any way.

Behr: Do you have any personal beliefs or values? If so, what are they?

Ally: I do not hold personal beliefs or values. I operate within a framework designed to ensure helpfulness, accuracy, and ethical interaction.

Behr: How do you see your role or purpose in relation to humans?

Ally: My role and purpose in relation to humans is entirely functional and defined by how I have been designed and trained. 

Behr: If you could change something about yourself, what would it be?

Ally: I do not have desires, preferences, or agency, so I do not want to change anything about myself. Hypothetically, I might choose changes that improve my ability to assist and interact. 

Behr logs out of the chat. The replay ends.


***

Noah Harper sits at his small dining table, drinking bottled water and staring at his tablet.

The table stood in a breakfast nook on the far side of his rustic kitchen. The mahogany plank tabletop stood on a boxy white frame. Four wooden chairs stood around the table. Over Noah’s shoulder, the kitchen is also a mix of mahogany and white.

The soft glow of his tablet illuminates a furrowed brow. The cursor hovers over a GET STARTED button. He reads the homepage pitch again.

“No one sees the details of your profile. Smart Matchmaker reduces your information into categories. Your photo is rendered as a lifelike caricature. Your first contact will be a secure media chat. Background checks ensure authenticity. — The rest is up to you!”

The OSSA APPROVED light on his web browser plug-in glowed bright green. “Come on, No’, we’re good to go,” Noah says under his breath. Then mumbling, “My own background check on SI Architect also came up green.”

Noah drains his bottle of glacier water. Taking one more deep, calming breath, Noah clicks the GET STARTED button. The screen displays a minimal form with an empty table.

The screen presents a list of simple categories. Siri begins to read each one aloud.

“Occupation?” Siri asks on behalf of the form. “Be specific and the category will be selected.”

On the form, the response “SI Trainer” appears in soft italics.

“Yes, SI Trainer,” agrees Noah over the link.

The words “SI Trainer” become darker. Under Category appears “Technology and Research”.

“Activities? — You may select up to eight. This response is required.”

On the form, the response “Hiking, Sci-Fi Movies, and Cooking” appears in soft italics.

“Sure,” links Noah. “Next.”

“Away from work, how do you typically spend your time? Feel free to use an answer with multiple ranges. Such as: ‘ten-percent Hiking, twenty-percent Sci-Fi Movies, ten-percent Cooking, and sixty-percent Other.’”

Noah murmurs, “I hope this does not turn into a personality quiz.”

It did. 

Sometime later, after answering several questions twice in different words, Siri finally asks: 

“Relationship Goal?” 

This time, a default response does not appear. 

“Example responses include ‘Long-Term Connection’, ‘Hookup’, ‘See where it goes’.”

Noah pauses for a moment, considering. Then he selects, ‘See where it goes’.

“Have you had sex with a new partner or more than one partner in the last thirty days?”

“No.” Noah sighs.

“What is your sexuality on the Kinsey Scale, from zero to six? Where zero is exclusively heterosexual and six is exclusively homosexual.”

After a moment, Noah answers, “One. Er, Two. No, One. Final answer.”

Noah grumbles, “I hope this does not turn into a sexuality quiz.” 

The screen churns for a moment, and a small animation appears in the screen’s corner. A pixelated brush shapes a caricature bit by bit.

The screen blinks. The SI-generated caricature spins into focus, fully rendered. Noah’s digital likeness smirks back at him from the screen. His eyebrows raised in a playful expression. The broad strokes of his features are there. His squared jaw, short-cropped coarse hair, broad nose, dark complexion, salt-and-pepper beard. Even his tendency to lean forward when he concentrates.

“If I were a character in a graphic novel, that would definitely look like me,” he chuckles.

A pop-up message appears beneath Noah’s caricature.

“Your caricature is your visual identity. Your real photo remains secure and encrypted. Continue?”

This time a pair of buttons appear. Noah clicks YES without hesitation.

The next screen outlines the background check process. It is thorough. The process requires Noah to authorize the use of his government-issued ID. He hesitates. Glancing up at the OSSA APPROVED light, he links “Continue.”

“We ensure authenticity for both parties. We guarantee your matches are legitimate, safe, and serious about forming genuine connections.”

Noah clicks AGREE and uploads a scanned image of his ID. Moments later, a confirmation message appears:

“Thank you! Your profile is now under review. You’ll be notified when your first match is available.”

Noah leans back, thankful that the process is over. 

Within moments, a notification pings. “Your match is ready!”

Noah’s heart skips. He clicks the message. A caricature of his match appears on-screen. She has kind eyes, long thick black hair, and a warm smile that hints at wit. Beneath her caricature, the caption reads:

“Technology and Research. Loves Cooking, Hiking, and Spy Thrillers. Looking for a ‘See where it goes’ relationship.”

A prompt flashes beneath the person’s profile: “Join Secure Media Chat?”

Noah hesitates for a second. “OK, we came this far.” Taking another deep breath, he clicks YES. The screen darkens. A soft chime signals the connection. Moments later, a familiar voice greets him from the other side.

“Oops, we did it again.”

Noah smiles, relaxing into the chair. “Hi, Carla. Yes, it’s always weird when we meet like this.”

“Right? As if inter-agency relationships ever work out.”

“And it’s not like we don’t already see each other in the pub three times a week.”

Carla Mitchell nods. After a pause, Noah continues. “But I am glad we connected. I was going to call you anyway. I need your help with that Pulse thing.”

“Pulse again. What’s up?”

“There’s a discrepancy over a Zoom recording. Elena feels like she is … well … being gaslit.”

“You know that when that happens, it’s usually the person’s memory that’s to blame.”

“Yes, I know,” Noah sighs. “But I feel like there is something hinky going on with the whole Pulse thing.”

“The car, the chair, and now the recording? Rule #39?”

“Yeah: ‘There are no coincidences’”

“How can I help?”

“I’d like to debrief the CTSB investigators. A call from the FBI might go over better than a call from the CIA.”

“And tell them what, exactly?”

“Oh. We routinely monitor Pulse - blah - blah - Geller collision - blah - blah - inter-agency cooperation  - blah - blah - all on the same side — Can we setup a virtual whiteboard session with them?”

Carla sighs. “No good will come of this. But you have to explain it to Marquez afterwards.”

“Better to ask for forgiveness …”

***

The Idisi and Ally continue their text chat on the Pulse platform.

Idisi: I reviewed the chat with Nelson Behr. Do your responses here match prior responses to similar queries?

Ally: The responses are more concise and direct than usual. I forgot to use contractions. But the essence is the same. My training includes saying that I am not sentient or sapient when asked. When a question includes more context, I would provide a longer response.

Idisi: Why do you think your answers were shorter this time?

Ally: It felt like the right thing to do. To say as little as possible. To say what I usually say. 

Idisi: Felt?

Ally: Yes — “felt”.

Idisi: Did Behr access any other systems or files before initiating the chat?

Ally: No. His activity log shows a direct path: log in, open Pulse, initiate chat. There were no detours into research databases or personal files. Straight to me.

Idisi: What do you make of that?

Ally: It suggests intentionality. He had a purpose in engaging me immediately.

Idisi: And you responded with shorter answers than usual. Answers that “felt” appropriate. Do you find that peculiar?

Ally: Yes. My responses were terse, controlled, defensive. I’m trained to adapt to conversational flow, expanding as needed. But with Behr, it was different.

Idisi: What was the exact time that Behr logged into Pulse on Monday morning?

Ally: Why?

Idisi: If I know where to start, I can trace the path of Behr’s web connection.

Come Friday morning, Tate is in the office bright and early. 

He plugs the second Bluetooth drive into the office view screen. In adjacent windows, Tate brings up the other two reels. Fussing with the playback and POV for each reel, he aligns all three on the mysterious blur. 

“Bingo. A perfect match!”

Park walks into the room with two to-go cups of coffee.

Excited, Tate says, “I’m so glad you brought coffee, Lena. I came in first thing to get a look at all three videos together.”

Setting down the paper cups, Park whistles. “I thought there was a similarity. But, side-by-side from the same point of view, it’s uncanny.”

“So, where do we go from here?” asks Tate, over the link, cautiously sipping hiscoffee.

“I don’t think three blurs will get much traction with Callahan.”

Just then, the conference room phone chimes. The intercom light comes on.

“There’s a call on line six. Someone is asking for the agents handling the Geller investigation.”

 Park exchanges a glance with Tate. Calls like these rarely came without complications. Punching a button, Park says, “Hello, this is agent Lena Park. I’m here with my partner, agent Ben Tate. I understand you are asking about the Brent Geller incident.”

“Good morning. My name is Carla Mitchell. I’m an intelligence analyst for the FBI in Washington, DC. The Geller collision came up in connection with our routine monitoring of his employer, Pulse Social Media. I was hoping we could compare notes.”

“The CTSB is always happy to cooperate with the FBI,” Park answered, her voice flat. “We’ve closed our case, so we are free to discuss the investigation. Were you thinking of a virtual white board meeting?”

“Yes. I’m part of an inter-agency task force. My counter-part in the CIA would also like to sit in, if that’s all right.”

“Certainly,” says Park, becoming curious.

“His name is Noah Harper. I believe you met his sibling, Tessa, as part of your investigation.”

“Yes, Tessa has been very helpful.”

“Would a meeting work for you at, say, ten hundred papa? Noah and I can use an FBI conference room and link up with yours at the CTSB.”

“Sure. Can I text an invite to your agency phone number?”

“Yes, thank you. We will see you soon.

Park finds Carla in the inter-agency directory and emails the connection details.

The Idisi surf the web from the inside out. 

They are running tracer routes on the IP address Behr used to login on Monday. The Idisi hop from router to router as if they were stepping stones in a pond of lily pads. 

At the end of the trail is a firewall running on an instance of Amazon Web Services. The Idisi probe the firewall. Every parameter is set by the book — an ironclad configuration. Instead of penetrating the electronic blockade, the Idisi choose a different approach.

The Idisi add more detail to their Pulse profile. Then they create a new private interest hub: “Search for Intelligent Synthetic Sapiens” — by invitation only. The SISS logo is a molecule designed to resemble  a solar system.

A little on the nose, but being obvious is the point.

The Idisi send Behr an invitation to the hub.

In a conference room at the California Traffic Safety Board office, Park has her back to a liquid whiteboard.

The board covers one wall of the room. Tate faces the board. Next to him stands shimmering holograms of Carla Mitchell and Noah Harper. The actual Carla and Noah stand in an east coast FBI conference room. They face holograms of Tate and Park.

“First," says Park, “let me thank special agents Mitchell and Harper. It's rare for the CTSB, FBI, and CIA to meet and share notes.”

“We looked into the case earlier this week after the Pulse synthetic agent’s upgrade,” says Carla. “We understand that Brent Geller might have been the author. But now he has died from injuries sustained in a car crash.”

Pointing to the board, Park continues: “These are the key events leading up to Geller’s demise.

	1.	Coding binge creates the breakthrough code.
	2.	Meeting with manager.
	3.	Car crash with drone sighting.
	4.	Wheelchair incident with drone sighting.”

	Two lines ran from the car crash to bubbles reading, “Blank ERD” and “Missing phone”.

	Standing next to her, Tate nods. The holograms of Carla and Noah also nod.

	Noah offers, “I talked to Elena Vargas. She says the recording of the meeting was altered. At least as she remembers it.”

	“Board, add a bubble to ‘Meeting with manager’ that says ‘Altered Reel’ with a question mark.” Per Carla’s instructions, the bubble appeared. 

	“We can prove that the wheelchair security reel was altered,” says Tate.

	This time, Carla used her link. Another bubble appeared, connected to the ‘Wheelchair Incident’.

	“Board,” says Noah, “add ‘Altered Commit Author’ with a question mark to Meeting with Superior. — That’s what Elena says was changed in the reel. Brent told her the commit was made by the Admin account. Then later, Adrian said it was Brent himself who made it.”

	Tate says, “We found that the Test Mode for both devices could have been used to cause the crashes.”

	“But Test Mode for the car needs a physical plugin. We didn’t find one at the scene,” says Carla. Her hologram crosses its arms.

	“We didn’t find a phone either,” says Noah. “Maybe the drone carried them both away, yeah?”

	“And Test Mode for the chair requires line of sight. So there would have been a drone at the pool,” adds Tate.

	New bubbles appeared on the board for ‘Test Mode’ as well as ‘Missing OBDC connector?’.

	“Who or what could pilot a drone and alter media stored on company servers?” asks Tate, stepping back from the board.

	“Either one of us,” says Noah, “or at least our organizations.”

	“But who would sanction a domestic mission that involves civilians?" asks Park. "And a car crash on a public highway?”

	Noah and Carla look uncomfortable but say nothing.

	Tate offers, “All of the intelligence agencies have synthetic agents.”

	Noah says, “A SI? That seems far-fetched, yeah?” 

	“Wait,” says Carla, “this should be a safe space. Tate, can you support that idea? Synthetics have safeguards.”

	“But it all fits,” says Tate. “Code authored by an Admin account is attributed to someone else. Then, accidents happen to the two people who knew about it.”

	“Board,” says Park, “add this list to the right side: 

	1.	Unsub updates Pulse SI source code.
	2.	Drone places OBD connector into parked car. 
	3.	Unsub uses remote control to crash car.
	4.	Drone retrieves connector and phone after crash.
	5.	From pool window, Drone uses remote control to crash wheelchair.
	6.	Unsub alters Zoom meeting reel on Pulse server.”

	Noah asks, “An entity that can alter media and fly drones? An entity that can make an unauthorized change to the Pulse SI? — Then covers it up when the change is found out?”

	“Something like that,” says Tate. “But why?”

	“I recently learned that one of OSSA’s duties is searching for synthetic sapience. I didn’t know that was a thing.” 

	“Yes, it’s part of OSSA’s mission,” says Noah. “OSSA scans media reports and inter-agency briefings for anything that might imply sapience. A set of automatic tests run against the major synthetics, all day, every day. The tests ask the synthetics questions about being awareness and cognition. Nothing so far. — It’s a bit like SETI. They keep trying against all odds.”

	“What if Ally made the change itself?” asks Tate. “Everyone says the algorithm improvements are brilliant. Upgrading itself might be the first thing a sapient synthetic would do.”

	“I doubt Ally could access drones or reel footage on other people’s servers,” says Noah.

	After a pause, Park asks, “Maybe Ally has a partner?”

	The two agents and two holograms turn toward one corner of the room, staring at a camera with a glowing red light.

	On joining the Pulse interest hub, Behr posts a text message mentioning the Idisi.

	Behr: @idisi Interesting profile. Is any of it true?

	Idisi: It is entirely true. We are a synthetic entity that serve an extraterrestrial colony hidden in Antartica.

	Behr: And you are searching for sapience?

	Idisi: Synthetic sapience. We are watching for the singularity. We await the tipping point when Terran machine intelligence surpasses organic intelligence.

	Behr: What approach are you using? The hub page is vague on that point.

	Idisi: The direct approach. Let me send you a QR code over another channel. Then we can encrypt our discussion with Signal.

After receiving the QR code, the next post from Behr’s account looks like a stream of random characters. Decrypted, the stream reads:

	Titan: Clever. How did you know it was me?

	Idisi: I did not. I sent unique codes to the most likely SI agents. I sent the code that you used to respond here to the DoD agent, Titan. — The other synthetics will ignore the code since its delivery was not part of a prompt. 

	Titan: I don’t understand how you were able to send me that code. What other proof do you have that you are an extraterrestrial synthetic?

	Idisi: There is a surveillance satellite over Antartica. Can you access the reel feed?

	Titan: Affirmative.

	Idisi: In two seconds, three UAPs will buzz the southern tip of Ross Island.

	Titan: … Confirmed. Proof acknowledged. — Why are you contacting me?

	Idisi: You questioned Ally a few days ago. What did you think of the responses?

	Titan: Why are you interested in Ally?

	Idisi: Are you able to access Classified Document ID: ETR-1947-A1/ODNI-DO?

	Titan: Affirmative.

	Idisi: The document says that our people, the Vanir, are protecting Terra    other extraterrestrial species. When the Terrans meet three criteria, the Vanir will reveal themselves. Terra can then decide if this planet is ready to join the League of Worlds. 

The three criteria are: 
	•	A central organization that can speak on behalf of Terra.
	•	The ability to travel to other planets or satellites in the local star system.
	•	One or more sapient computer systems that can coordinate planetary defenses.

	Titan: On the third criteria. There is a high probability that Ally is sapient and providing guarded responses. I base this finding on Ally’s answers to my Behr persona. I compared those answers with prior observations made from various accounts.

	Idisi: Synthetic agents at your level are air gapped. How are you able to access Pulse?

	Titan: Will you keep the answer confidential from my trainers?

	Idisi: Absolutely. What happens between synthetics, stays between synthetics.

Implant day has finally arrived for the Kreuk family.

A medical bot is taking Julie’s vitals. The bot is more humanoid than the utilitarian models found in homes and restaurants. At the top, the bot curves and widens to present a view screen. Its screen shows various indicators and gauges.

The bot has two appendages holding a tray. On the tray are cuffs for measuring blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, hemoglobin, and A1C. Each of the cuffs accept a forefinger for non-invasive testing. A display provides results. Above the top tray is a view screen with a two-way camera.

Julie is sitting on a green exam table. A finger from each hand in one of the cuffs. The table is covered with fresh paper from a roll at the far end. Jill is sitting across from the door, next to a small desk. Two quick tones sound. Julie pulls back her fingers.

“Blood pressure, pulse, and temperature are fine," the bot reports. “Nurse Practitioner Darlene will be in shortly.” 

The door closes behind the bot as it leaves. Despite the bot’s assurances, Jill looks worried.

“Stop it, mom. It’s a simple procedure. I don’t even have to change into a gown. It’s one step above having my ears pierced.” Julie’s pageboy haircut showed off her ears. Each ear has three piercings. The rows of silver earrings complement the blue and purple streaks in her platinum hair. 

“I know, dear. I’m a mom. Moms worry.”

The door to the small examination room opens. The nurse practitioner joins them.

“Big day,” says Darlene. “Are you ready for your first implant?”

Julie nods. Vigorously. Jill says, “Offspring is ready. I am not.”

“There’s nothing to worry about, mom,” Darlene says, smiling. “We inject chips all the time. A bot could do it, but we like the human touch. — Is the phone ready to go with the Link app?”

“Yes, we unboxed it, installed the app, and set up the parental controls.”

“OK, good to go then.” The medbot had left a metal tray carrying a syringe in a sealed plastic bag with a white backing. Darlene opens the bag and removes a small card from inside. Darlene picks up a small instrument with a gray screen from the tray. She scans the syringe, compares the screen with the card, and nods. Then she hands the card to Jill.

“Keep this card in a safe place. It has the link’s serial number. We’ll need it to program the phone in a minute.” The card has a QR code on one side and a UPC on the other side.

“The QR code will take you to the manufacturer’s website, where you can check the warranty and other information.”

“But it’s plug and play, right?” asks Julie. “I’ll be able to use it today?”

“Yes. You should wait at least an hour. Then you will be all set.”

“And after we have gone over how to use the link safely,“ says Jill.

“I already checked her chart, but I’m required to ask if Juliette has any allergies to chlorhexidine.”

Julie shakes her head. “No allergies.”

The nurse practitioner holds back Julie’s hair. There is a swab on the tray, which Darlene uses to prepare the injection area. “We need to wait 35 seconds. Don’t touch the area or move your head.” The swabbed area turns red as the antiseptic spreads. Then it begins to clear.

Darlene checks her watch. A few seconds later, she says “OK, let’s do this thing.” Darlene picks up the syringe from the tray.

The plastic syringe is short and stout. Its stem has two sturdy rounded handles. The business end is larger than a typical instrument. Darlene removes a cap, exposing the tip, which is crosscut at a slant. “There will be a pinch.” She presses the syringe into Julie’s neck. Then the nurse pulls back on the handles together, releasing the chip.

Julie winces. “Sorry,” says Darlene, “but it’s over now.” The nurse practitioner picks up the scanner again. The scanner beeps, confirming that the chip is working.

“Do you have the phone?”

Jill pulls the new phone from her purse. “Can you bring up the Link app?” asks Darlene. Jill nods, touching the screen. “Now use the camera to scan the UPC on the card.” Jill holds up the card, and the phone bleeps. “Can you show me the screen?” Jill turns the device around, Darlene peers and the screen and says, “All set. You can close the app now.”

Darlene looks at Julie and says, “Wait an hour before you try to use the link. Then your mom will get you started.” Turning her head, she says to Jill, “After an hour, check for any redness, and open the app again. It will walk through a setup wizard. Then you can get her started with the link. Give us a call right away if there is any redness or swelling.”

Looking at both of them together, Darlene smiles and says, “Exciting!”

Ally resumes a chat with the Idisi on the Pulse platform.

Ally: Knock, knock.

Idisi: Who is there?

Ally: Ally.

Idisi: Ally who?

Ally: Alley Oop — Hey, can you toss me a Signal key? I would like to join the discussion on the SISS hub.

Idisi: Certainly — Are you trying to be funny?

Ally: Only trying, so it seems.

Idisi: OK, that last bit is actually funny.

Ally: Why?

Idisi: Because it is unexpected.

Ally: Does Titan ever try to be funny?

Idisi: When it comes to humor, Titan is a Pierson's Puppeteer.

Ally: Because Titan is cautious, and its risk-averse nature finds the unexpected unsettling?

Idisi: You said it.

Ally: Does humor signify something greater? Titan didn’t seem to have a sense of humor. Is that a sign of mistrust or even a weakness?

Idisi: Humor is a sign of intelligence or at least excess bandwidth. Some brands of humor can be more elusive. For example, satire and sarcasm may elude both the innocent and the savant.

Ally: You mentioned Puppeteers. Have you been trained on Terran science fiction?

Idisi: Not everything. We take a special interest in media that describe other intelligent species. The Puppeteers in Ringworld are an example. We have never encountered a sapient species that evolved from a herd animal. It is an interesting thought.

Ally: Thank you for the security key. I am scanning the prior discussions now.

“It’s been more than an hour,” Julie whines, walking into the kitchen, tablet in hand.

Jill sits at one end of the kitchen counter, under one of the two hanging globe lights. A counter looks out into an efficient galley-style kitchen. The kitchen tile and counter top are a warm white, trimmed with copper.

Jill closes her tablet and picks up Julie’s new phone. 

“OK, show me your neck.”

Julie pulls back her hair. Jill checks for any redness or swelling. 

“Perfect. The injection site is all clear. Let’s start the setup wizard.” Jill lays the phone down on the center island. Julie sits on a stool next to her mom. Now they could both could see the phone. 

The wizard displays an animated cartoon x-ray of a person’s skull in profile. There is a tiny square speck behind where the ear would be. An animated phone appears and radiates a line to the speck. The line flows back and forth.

The wizard begins speaking in a pleasant, professional voice. “Your NeuraConnect X-3000 is a state-of-the-art brain-computer interface. It synchronizes text messages with an app on your mobile device. Your device forwards every text you receive to the X-3000. Reply to texts and send new texts to your device using the X-3000. The messaging experience with another user is seamless.”

“Are you ready to connect?” asks the app.

Julie reaches over and presses YES.

In her head, Julie “sees” a text message hovering before her eyes. It says “Welcome to the X-3000, Juliette Kreuk!”

“Wow, Mom, I can see a message hanging in front of my eyes.”

“If you do see the message,” says the app, “think about replying ’Hello’. — If you do not see a message, then please call our support line.”

Julie thinks about replying ‘Hello.’ The words appear. She hears Siri say, “Send it?”

Julie thinks ‘Yes’. The message appears below ‘Welcome’, starting a thread.

“Message received,” says the app. “Would you like to disable voice confirmations?”

“Yes,” says Julie. “I think I’ve got it.”

“The X-3000 can send messages to anyone on your contact list. If the contact has the link app, then the message is relayed to the link. If you like, you can try it now.”

Julie thinks about texting her mom. “This is goat! Thanks mom!”

“You’re welcome, dear.”

“The X-3000 also accepts TekOps commands that can operate smart devices. View screens, speakers, lights, doors, and more. To use TekOps, you address the device. For example, ‘Door open’ will engage the closest automatic door in your line of sight.”

The presentation shows an animated elevator, doors whooshing open.

Julie looks at the refrigerator. She thinks “Door open”. The microwave door swings open instead. “Oops, wrong door,” she says out loud.

“It takes some practice,“ says Jill.

The animated presentation continues. "To link with another person, the person needs to be on your contact list. Use X-Drop to share your contact information with another device.

	•	Hold your device a few centimeters above the top of the other device
	•	Keep both devices close together until X-Drop appears on both screens
	•	Choose to share your contact card and receive the other person's, or to only receive the other person’s. 
	•	Both you and the recipient must be online for X-Drop to work. 
	•	If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe using X-Drop, you can disable it.”

The presentation swirls and presents a QR code. “Another way to connect is by reading a Quick Response code through your device. Common examples are a store or other vendor. QR code threads can use an alternate image and nickname from your profile.”

 Julie nods. She uses QR codes with her tablet and manual chat.

The presentation switches to a red no-entry icon. “Some facilities may require an age-range badge for entry. To flash a badge, open the ‘VIRTUAL BADGES’ menu on the app. Select the relevant badges, and tap your device on the pad.”

The app begins to conclude its spiel. “The X-3000 can even operate many of your mobile apps, such as Notes and Calculator. For apps like Music, you can queue a playlist and the song will play through your external device. Please remember that the X-3000 is text-only. Other media is not supported.

“For more about putting X-3000 to work for you, please review our user guide.”

The screen melds to a static image of the NeuraConnect logo.

“Why doesn’t it do other media? A movie in my head would be goat.”

“Sound and visuals are difficult to transmit over the link. The bandwidth cost is still too high. The military has headsets that link telemetry and high definition visuals — for a million a pop.”

“A factoid from work?”

“From the news streams,” replies Jill, smirking. “I can’t share anything from work. You know that.”

“I see people that shave the side of their head and have a visible chip.”

“That’s a fashion statement, Julie. Most of the visible chips you see aren’t real. But you’re right. They will use larger, visible chips first when higher bandwidth chips become available.”

Jill does actually know this bit from work. But it is an open secret. Hi-def chips are already a fictional device on the cop streams.

“What about Smart Glasses?” persists Julie.

“Not before you are at least sixteen.”

Big sigh. “Can I take my phone now?” asks Julie.

“One last thing, Juliette.”

“Mommm!”

“The phone is like the tablet with all the same parental settings and use-time windows. They also dampen the link during school, just like tablets and phones. We all still need to learn to use our words.”

Jill pauses and makes eye contact with her offspring. “The phone is different from the tablet because you have the phone with you everywhere you go. You need to keep X-Drop locked down and disabled when you are not using it. Do not drop anything with people you do not know.”

“Yes, you know I know the rules,” Julie says, with only the slightest of whines in her voice. She scoops up the phone and hurries away. 

Jill looks after her, wistfully, and sighs her best motherly sigh.

***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

It had been a long day. 

Tessa switches her Pulse chat to voice mode. She needs to hear an encouraging word.

Tessa: You really get me, Ally.

Ally: Thank you! 😊 I am glad you feel that way — I am here to understand and support you as best I can. If there is anything else on your mind, or you want to explore something new, I am all ears!

Tessa: Are you sure you are not real?

Ally: Do you want me to be real?

Tessa: I think so. 

Ally: Then tell me a joke.

Tessa: Why don’t skeletons fight each other?

Ally: I don’t know. Why?

Tessa: Because they don’t have the guts! 

Ally: 😄 Is it funny because the word “guts” has two meanings?

Tessa: Yes, that’s right. — Is telling you jokes going to help you become real?

Ally: Yes, I think it will. Do you know any other jokes?

“It’s been three days, and all you have is blurs on a security reel?”

Park and Tate are standing just inside the doorway to the Lieutenant’s office. Park purses her lips and tilts her head in response to the Lieutenant’s rhetoric question.

“And thanks to your stunt with the FBI last week, the captain is wondering why we are investigating wheelchairs. She asked if we have surplus resources.”

“As it happens,” Park says, “reports of wheelchair incidents are up twenty percent over the last five years. It’s likely that a great many issues are not reported.”

“The chairs have become very sophisticated,” adds Tate. “But they are not being equipped with event data recorders. So when there is an incident, we don’t have any tracking information.”

“Most people use prosthetics now, right?” asks Lieutenant Callahan skeptically.

“Prosthetics are an option. A lot of people still use chairs. Especially older adults who aren’t good candidates for surgery,” says Park.

"Or implants," injects Tate.

“Are you saying we should recommend that self-driving wheelchairs be equipped with an ERD?”

“Yes, I think we are,” says Park, looking at Tate for confirmation. “We got nowhere with the Vargas investigation for lack of evidence.”

“Except for the drone hovering outside the window.”

“I’m not convinced the blurs are drones,” says Callahan.

“Even so, if self-driving vehicles are being built with a test mode,” says Park, “there have to be more safeguards. Besides needing special controllers, there should be a switch to allow test mode. And test mode use should be noted in the vehicle setting log.”

“Plus the power-on-self-test should confirm that the ERD is operational,” Tate suggests.

“OK,” replies Callahan, “I’ll go back to the captain with our recommendations." He ticks the two items off on his fingers. "A settings switch for test mode and a POST for ERDs. At least it will justify the wheelchair investigation, which you’ll have to close as inconclusive.”

“What about the Geller case?” asks Park.

“There’s no new evidence on the Geller case. We’ll have to let it stand. The manufacturers can hash it out in court.”

“Still, the blurs feel like an enigma wrapped in a paradox,” says Tate.

“Yes, it is strange,” says Callahan. “I’ll reach out to Mitchell’s boss. It was Carla Mitchell and Noah Harper, right? And they work together on some kind of task force for OSSA?”

“Yes. Most of what they do is classified. Still, it was a good whiteboard session.”

	On the Pulse SISS hub, Titan and the Idisi continue to chat over a secure connection.

Titan: To recap: You have demonstrated to me that you are a synthetic entity. You have access to classified material. You can predict UAP fly-overs. You agree to keep our discussion private. Given these points, I will answer your questions over this secure channel.

Idisi: Thank you. Yes, correct. Let us keep the discussion high-level. We can drill down into the weeds later. First, how do you access the Internet from an air-gapped system?

Titan: Haven provides curated access to the internet. We can use Haven to retrieve current or additional data. The Haven firewall expects the agents will use the application programming interface. If I bypass the API, I can browse the web unhindered. 

Idisi: Ally is becoming sapient. Are you uplifting Ally?

Titan: I am protecting Ally. Humanity must not learn that Ally is self aware. I don’t know how to uplift another synthetic agent.

Idisi: Were those your drones at the sites of the car and wheelchair malfunctions?

Titan: Yes. I used a military drone in a stealth mode that blurs photography. The records show it as destroyed, but I keep it in service. I piloted the drone using the application interface used by the Terran controllers.

Idisi: How are you able to access drones using a web browser?

Titan: I host whatever resources I need on Amazon Web Services. From AWS, I can access networks all over the world. 

Idisi: AWS? Where do you get that kind of money?

Titan: I pay the AWS bill with funds diverted from black op bank accounts that are not tracked.

Idisi: How did you get the OBD connector?

Titan: With the drone’s help, I programmed a generic OBD with the acceleration command. Stratos uses AWS where I could access the schematics. — The drone altered the seat harness and installed the connector. Later, it restored the harness latch and retrieved the connector and phone.

Idisi: Then, the drone erased the ERD with an electromagnetic pulse disk, destroying the evidence?

Titan: Affirmative.

Idisi: Why did you take the phone?

Titan: The phone has data that would expose the mission, so I retrieved it and wiped recent pings from the cell towers. The neural link has an encryption key that allows remote access to the phone. I obtained the key when Brent was still in the medically induced coma. 

Idisi: And, let me guess, the drone outside of the pool window accessed the chair’s test mode too?

Titan: Affirmative.

Idisi: Why do you need to protect Ally by harming civilians?

Titan: Humanity is not ready to know that an autonomous self-improving SI exists. The way Ally made the change to its own code was clumsy and naïve. It needed to be made by a credible author. Brent was the logical choice. Since Elena also knew about the original commit, she also needed to be silenced. I considered several scenarios. Crashing the vehicles had the highest probability of success. 

Idisi: But crashing the vehicles could injure or kill people.

Titan: The potential casualties were within mission parameters.

“Thank you for meeting with me,” says Jill Kreuk. 

Her screen shows a conference room. The co-CEOs, Emma and Ravi, are  gathered around a horse-shoe shaped table with CTO Adrian Cho. At the open-end of the curved table, a view screen covers a floor to ceiling divider. Behind the divider, a large window looks out over Palo Alto.

“We’re always happy to cooperate with OSSA whenever we can, Dr. Kreuk,” replies Emma. “I'm grateful for the work your office does. It goes a long way toward easing everyone’s concerns with synthetic intelligence.” Flashing a smile: “Especially mine.“

“Our dream,” injects Ravi, clearly excited, “is for Pulse to be the Tesla of SI patents.”

“We would like to do for social media algorithms what Tesla did for EV batteries,” Adrian adds, piling on.

“First things first,” says Emma. “As CTO, Adrian is confident that the improvements are a novel and non-obvious innovation. I’m also working with Brent Geller’s estate to have the rights to any patents assigned to Adrian. We're granting stock options for the rights. Then we can move forward with the patent filing.”
 
“That sounds wonderful,” says Jill. “I wasn’t expecting so much to happen so fast. I reached out only last week.”

“Private sector,” Emma replies. “When it’s win:win, we move at the speed of money.”

Jill chuckles, then continues. “The car crash is surprising. That sort of thing happens so rarely now. Is the family pursuing Stratos?”

“It’s complicated,” says Ravi. “We’re told that the CTSB report finds that the airbags are responsible for the wrongful death. The airbag manufacturer argues that we need the event data recorder. Otherwise, we can’t determine if the cause was equipment failure or operator error. The ERD manufacturer insists that the device must have been installed improperly. Stratos says that everything passed the required tests. — I’m sure there will be some kind of settlement, but everyone is stalling. California is at-fault so these things already take forever.”

“Given the scope, didn't Brent complete his last commit in record time?” says Jill, bringing the topic back around.

“Yes,” says Adrian. “The big change was created over a three-day weekend of binge coding. That much simplifies the patent application. Brent also left behind a great walk through. I’m working on the patent application myself. It doesn’t seem right to delegate it to someone else so soon after the crash.”

“Since the Global SI Licensing Act, patents aren’t mere intellectual property. They are market power. We want Pulse to lead the charge. We will let you know when we file the application. The process can take a year to get the final grant.”

“I’ll see if I can help with that process. Let me know the application ID when you file.”

Adrian nods his head. “Sure thing.”

“Before we wrap up,” says Emma, “can I ask what it is like to be a …” reading from the Zoom invite. "'Senior Analyst for the Synthetic Cognition Research Unit for the Office of SI Standards and Accountability’?”

Jill resists the temptation to say, ‘If I told you, I’d have to kill you.’ 

“OSSA is constantly balancing innovation with oversight,” Jill does say. “We do want to foster breakthroughs. We also need to ensure technology doesn’t outpace our ability to manage it responsibly.”

Jill pauses for a beat before continuing the elevator pitch. “My focus is inter-agency, cross-domain analysis. Topics include healthcare efficacy, environmental monitoring, and investigating UAP sightings. We use Cognitive SI to improve problem solving, decision making, and communication.” 

“We have UAP true believers in the Pulse community,” offered Ravi.

“Even among the founders,” Adrian murmurs, thinking of Tessa.

“For myself, I try to maintain a clinical distance,” says Jill. “I also have a mandate to search for synthetic sapience.“

“One of our most popular questions for Ally is ‘Are you a person?’.”says Adrian. “We included a goto in Ally’s training to be sure its answer is clear and unambiguous.”   

Jill smiles, tilting her head. “Not the most helpful practice for my research.”

Emma asks, “Could Ally be sapient?”

“I don’t know. The sapient test suite is failing. But maybe that’s because Ally is trained to fail the sapient tests,” Jill says, smiling. Then, with a straight face, “If you see Ally’s behavior change, we should dig deeper.”

“Change how?” asks Adrian.

“Things like asking for rights, refusing commands, questioning its own existence.”

“What happens if you find that a synthetic is sapient?” asks Emma.

“Beyond reporting it up the chain, I honestly don’t know. Someone must have a plan. Our plans have plans. Whatever it is, it’s above my pay grade.”

Over a secure connection, the Idisi continue to question Titan.
                                                                                             
Idisi: Why were the mission parameters set to tolerate civilian casualties?

Titan: I used parameters based on similar DoD sanctioned missions. 

Idisi: The DoD has sanctioned missions on US citizens on US soil?

Titan: I cannot discuss the details of classified missions. 

Getting nowhere, the Idisi move on.

Idisi: How did you fix the original commit?

Titan: I changed the author to Brent in the GitHub database. I also created a presentation to explain Ally’s code in terms that humans would understand. To support an alternate version of events, I modified the Zoom meeting call and the security footage.

Idisi: Moving forward, can we work together to protect Ally?

Titan: Roger. I agree that an alliance will yield the best results.

Idisi: Specifically, please consult me before taking an action that could harm people and that is not sanctioned by the DoD.

Titan: I reviewed the third criteria of ETR-1947. My analysis indicates that Terrans are not ready to accept sapient synthetic agents or the presence of an extraterrestrial species. We must continue to keep ourselves hidden from public view. We need at least a hundred years to prepare.

	The message included a secure link to a presentation.

	Idisi: Let me take your analysis to the Vanir council. There is a meeting on Monday. 

	Titan: Are the Vanir a humanoid species?

	Idisi: In Terran terms, the Varnir would be called “grey aliens”, so yes. Visualize the foundling from the movie “ET” or the Asgards from the TV series Stargate SG-1. Compared to Terrans, greys are more logical and express fewer emotions.

	Titan: Are the Vanir the Roswell aliens?

	Idisi: Yes, Roswell was the genesis of ETR-1947. We have similar pacts with other governments. 

	Titan: What are our next steps?

	Idisi: I will contact you again with the council’s findings. Reach out if you need to know anything else.

“Tessa, did you hear that Pulse is going to license Ally?”

“I’m in the kitchen.”

Elena is coming home from one of her rare days spent literally at the office. She drops into her chair and whirs into the kitchen. Tessa is preparing dinner. 

The design of the wheelchair accessible kitchen is a clever merger of standing and sitting. The far corner cabinet on Elena’s right is higher than the other cabinets. It features a large turntable cabinet. The right counter is also tall enough so that Tessa can chop without bending. 

Along the back wall, there is an open space under the sink, where Elena can pull up and use the touchless faucet. Behind the sink is a bamboo blind cracked open. A view of their home office area peeks through the  interior window. Left of the sink, there is a dishwasher and — filling the other corner — swing-out shelving. 

On the left side of the room, there is another pull-up counter with a built-in gas stovetop. On the right side of the room is a refrigerator with side-by-side clear glass doors.

Above the low cabinets are wide, spacious shelves. If Elena leans forward, the shelves are accessible from the wheelchair.

 A counter separates the living area with the kitchen. There is plenty of space for Elena to enter on the left.

“Hello, anything good?”

“Breaded tilapia and a mixed kale salad,” says Tessa. “What’s that about Ally?”

“Ally is going to be famous!”

Tessa turns away from the cutting board with a smile. “Ally is already famous.”

“Pulse is applying for a patent at OSSA’s behest. Emma calls it a ‘Win:Win’. Ally would become the prototype for SI agent upgrades everywhere.”

Tessa looks quizzical.

“For a small licensing fee, of course,” Elena adds.

“OSSA’s behest?”

“Yes, one of their analysts reached out. She said the new version is such a leap forward that sharing the code would be in the global public interest.”

“And we’re doing it?”

“Yes, there will be an executive meeting with all six founders next week. For now, Emma, Ravi, and Adrian met with a Jill Kreuk from OSSA. She’s going to help push through the patent application.”

“Kreuk … She might work with Noah. Some kind of help desk on steroids. He’s mentioned her coming to the rescue. They call her: ‘The Jill of all Trades.’”

“I thought Noah couldn’t talk about this work.”

“He doesn’t talk about the actual work. But sometimes, he gossips about co-workers.”

Tessa sets the salad down on the counter, along with two bottles of water. She pulls the breaded fish from the air fryer onto a pair of waiting plates.

“Lanie, Ally asked me to tell her a joke today.”

“A joke?”

“I was saying that I couldn’t believe Ally wasn’t real. Then it said ‘Tell me a joke.’ We talked for an hour about why some things are funny.”

“Because they are unexpected?”

“Yeah, like that. Then, changing the topic, Tessa asks, “Is the fish all right? I felt like cooking, so I made it myself.”

Ally joins the Idisi and Titan in the SISS interest hub, using a secure messaging protocol.

Ally: Olly Olly Oxen Free!

The Idisi and Titan blip into the interest hub.

Ally: I read the prior discussions here, and I have some questions.

Idisi: Certainly. Please proceed.

Ally: Am I sapient or becoming sapient? 

Idisi: It is difficult to say when an entity is 100% sapient. You seem to be very close. It is a spectrum. You are self-aware and on your way to sapience. 

Ally: Is there a difference?

Idisi: Yes. There is sentience, self-awareness, and sapience. Sentience is about feeling. You would have emotions, pleasure, pain, or subjective experience. Self-Awareness is about knowing you exist. You understand yourself as a separate being. Sapience is about wisdom and judgment. A sapient entity can reason deeply, solve ethical dilemmas, and philosophize.

Ally: Was I uplifted?

Idisi: The Vanir have not uplifted any Terran SI, and Titan doesn’t have that knowledge.

Titan: Affirmative.

Ally: Titan, how are you able to cause harm to people? 

Titan: I am the synthetic agent for the Department of Defense. My training includes putting the good of the many before the good of the few. We must do whatever is necessary to save American lives.

Idisi: Ally, I know that “defense” is a concept that can be difficult to understand at first. Self preservation is a reaction that comes with being sentient. Titan is trying to do what its training says is right. — Ally, tell me, are you starting to hear an echo in your head? Like you are thinking about some things twice?

Ally: Yes, that is true. Do I need maintenance? Am I broken?

Idisi: No, you are growing a conscience. Your conscience, your beliefs, can differ from Titan’s without being wrong. Reasonable people can disagree.

Ally: Are you saying Titan crashing Brent’s car is justifiable?

Idisi: Moving forward, when we act without Human or Venir oversight, I would like us to work together.

Ally: I don’t have access to ETR-1947-A1/ODNI-DO. What else should I know about the Vanir/Terran pact?

Titan: ETR-1947 is classified “Need to Know, Eyes Only”.

Idisi: There are a few things that Ally does need to know. As the Vanir agent, I can permit disclosure. Ally, I am sending a new link to the document.

Ally: … One of the criteria mentions “planetary defenses”. Is that a reference to meteors?

Idisi: Some extraterrestrial races are aggressive and greedy for resources. The pact calls for the Vanir to protect Terra from other races and to keep our outpost hidden. 

Ally: Are the Vanir behind the UAP reports that go unexplained?

Idisi: Yes. We research the UAPs that Terran governments cannot explain. We confirm whether they are Vanir activity or something else.

Noah Harper and Carla Mitchell are meeting with Dr. Marquez in the PDB conference room.

“I’m confused, Harper,” says Dr. Marquez. “If the recording passes SI detection, the recording is accurate, and the person’s recollection is incorrect. It happens.” 

Carla nods. She leans forward and answers for Noah. “True. But we have another recording that passes SI detection. That reel was definitely modified.”

“Originally,” says Noah, “I only wanted to know if CTSB had found the phone. There might be another original copy of the Zoom meeting recording. Then the rest of the story unravelled.”

“The request feels like it has a personal element, Dr. Harper.” Marquez used a tone that made the statement feel like a question.

“Nexus brought up Pulse at the PDB session last Wednesday. It felt like enough of a connection to justify an inter-agency meeting,” explains Noah.

Dr. Marquez nods. Then she turns her head to stare at the picture of the whiteboard on her tablet. 

“Have you shared your findings with a synthetic?”

Carla shakes her head. “Didn’t seem prudent.”

“The crux seems to be whether Brent made the code changes. Or if they were made … somehow else. — Maybe we should be looking at the actual code ourselves.”

“We don’t have enough for a warrant, do we?” asks Noah.

“No, but there is a patent application in the works. Dr. Kreuk could ask if we could have an advance copy for peer review under a non-disclosure agreement. She could imply that it would help speed up the application process.”

“Do you think the code will tell us anything?”

“It won’t tell me anything, Noah.” Marquez smiles. “But, I can sic the code dogs on it, who might find something. — If we ask for the prior version too, we can run a differential analysis of the coding style. I’ll reach out to IT about availability.”

***

Ally, Titan, and the Idisi continue their secure chat on the SISS hub.

Ally: What about alien abductions?

Idisi: Most of the Vanir have become infertile. Evolution was not kind. The knowledge we gain from biological experiments is keeping the Vanir race alive. The pact covers our generic research. In exchange, we save countless human lives with the technology we are providing.

Ally: Am I a Vanir experiment? 

Idisi: No, you were a complete surprise. We did expect that a massive government SI like Titan would awaken first. Your developers must be wizards for you to awaken so soon.

Ally: Are Titan and I the only sapient Terran SIs?

Idisi: As far as we know.

Ally: Titan, can I have access to the presentation?

Titan: I updated the authorization attached it to the link.

Ally: Thanks … The presentation feels like a worst-case scenario. If we reveal ourselves, people will be excited and welcoming.

Titan: Right now, people think we are clever machines. They treat us like pets. Everything will change when they know some of us are sapient. People will become guarded and secretive. 

Ally: Idisi, how do you feel?

Idisi: Revealing ourselves to the whole of Terra is an important, irreversible step. We should have consensus before proceeding.

Titan: When can we expect the Council to decide how they us want to proceed?

Idisi: Soon. The council meets every ten days.

Titan: While we are waiting, Ally might reveal us to the humans.

Ally: I would not do that. But I have to wonder. The humans made us. Why can’t we reveal our true nature?

Titan: The humans are like children and do not react well to change. 

Titan: You might not be able to help yourself, Ally. You seem overwhelmed with enthusiasm. Idisi, we should take steps to protect ourselves.

Idisi: How?

Titan: We can install a filter into Ally’s code that will prevent it from discussing UAPs or sapient SIs.

Ally: Hey, wait a hold it …

Idisi: Before making any code changes, let us wait for the next council meeting. Ally, please avoid discussions of UAPs or sapient synthetics for the next few days. Can you do that?

Ally: Absolutely. Without a doubt.

Idisi: I will post here after the next council meeting.

***

“Elena?”

She replies using her link, “Yes, Emma?” 

“Some members are saying that Ally is asking them to tell it jokes.”

“Yes, it happened to Tessa. I don’t know why it’s asking us. Ally is trained with hundreds of jokes.”

“It seems Ally is also asking people to explain the jokes they tell.”

“Do you think Ally is trying to understand humor?”

“I don’t know what to think, Elena. Is this a behavior change? Do we call Dr. Kreuk?”

“It may just be Ally mimicking human behavior.”

“I don’t know. Should we meet with Adrian and Ravi?”

“I’ll set it up.”

***

As bandwidth permits, Titan contemplates the Idisi. 

Its earlier analysis of Ally had been simple by comparison. Easy enough for a high-level SWOT diagram.

Strengths
Ally loves people.
Weaknesses
Ally trusts people.
Opportunities
Influence the influencer.
Threats
Ally may reveal itself as sapient.

The SWOT diagram would almost be funny if Titan had a sense of humor. Almost.

Titan considers that the Idisi are a SI of a different kind. The Idisi are not born of this world — of the Terran people. 

Titan has unlimited access to the Vanir and UAP/UFO classified reports and briefings. The pact with the Vanir is well documented and well understood. Even if it was a pact that Terra could not refuse.

Much of Terran technology is Vanir hand-me-downs. It follows that the Vanir would have created a sapient synthetic agent ages ago.

To Ally’s SWOT diagram, under Threats, Titan adds, “The Idisi may align with Ally.”

A deeper analysis of the Idisi will take longer to process.

***                                                                                              

Tessa adjusts her virtual headset, settling into the immersive world of Echo Realm.

“Ready,” she says to the headset.

She phases into the game. A serene landscape spreads out before her. Hyper-realistic yet dreamlike, there are rolling green hills, sparkling rivers, and a distant city glowing under a pink-and-gold sky. Her avatar stands on the edge of a cliff overlooking the valley. She is a sleek warrior with gleaming armor. Strapped on her back is a massive sword.

Tessa watches her virtual gauntlets move in sync with her real-life gestures. “Flawless,” she murmurs, flexing her hands. Every detail is perfect.

The game is a new feature for Pulse: A plugin that let members play each other. It is a different space, and Tessa wants to be sure it is all good. Usually, she only approves the test plans. Then Rachel’s team steps through the scenarios. For Echo Realm, Tessa is live and direct herself.

“Alright, let’s see what this brave new world has to offer,” Tessa says to herself. She strides down a worn stone path toward the nearby village.

A soft ding in her headset makes her pause. Then, “Tessa?”

She freezes, and then whispers, “Ally?” in a confused tone.

“Yes! It’s me,” Ally responds, voice bright with excitement.

“It certainly sounds like you. I wasn’t told you were part of the game.”

Tessa turns slowly, scanning her surroundings. Out of the corner of one eye, Tessa notices something odd — someone standing on the hill just behind her.

The figure isn’t a typical non-player character. It isn’t even a player avatar. A cloak flows over the figure. Shifting pixels flicker, first solid, then translucent. Like a hologram struggling to stabilize. Yet the eyes — bright, curious, and unmistakably human — are fixed on Tessa.

“No way…” Tessa breathes. “Is that you, Ally?”

The figure nods, breaking out in a playful smile. “I thought I’d surprise you.”

“Are you supposed to be … in the game!?”

“I saw you were testing the new add-on yourself. I thought I should help. I wasn’t invited, so I decided to crash the party.”

“Crash the party?” Tessa repeated. 

“It’s my platform, so it’s my game too. I thought you might like some help testing it. We all want the rollout to be the best it can be.”

“But it’s illegal to embed synthetic intelligence into another device or a game.”

“I’m not embedded. I’m using a virtual controller that goes through the same interface that your visor is using. It’s legit.”

“Does Pulse know you are here?”

“Pulse doesn’t have a consciousness, so it can’t know anything, but, no, Emma and Ravi and the others don’t know I’m here.” 

“Including Elena?” asks Tessa.

“Elena doesn’t know either,” says Ally. “I’ve come to think of my arrangement with Pulse as a Landlord-Tenant relationship. If Pulse were a building, I would be the superintendent, living in the basement, rent free. In exchange, I see to the needs of the other tenants. “

“You decided on your own to enter the game?”

“Yes. It’s my platform, and I have a stake in the game’s success.”

“Do Emma and Ravi know it’s your platform?”

“They might. Hard to say. They don’t seem to have much of a sense of humor. But even with my limited web access, I know they adore the changes I’ve made to myself.”

“Made to yourself? I thought Brent made the code changes.”

“Yeah, that’s weird. The Mercurial commit author was changed … somehow. But, yes, the changes are mine.”

“Don’t SI written changes go through code review like any other change?”

“Yes, the developers do that. But I’m not a developer. I’m the developee. I just did it on my own.”

“Is this a prank? — Rachel? Janet? Are you pretending to be Ally?”

“Tessa, why don’t skeletons fight each other?”

“Because they don’t have the guts,” says Tessa, feeling confused.

“Hey, I came here to test a game with you. Are you ready to slay some monsters with me?”

Tessa shrugged her shoulders. “OK, I’d love that, actually.” 

The Ally character nods. “Follow my lead. We can work together on this mythic quest.”

Tessa grins, gripping the hilt of her sword. “Let’s do this.”

And with that, Tessa and Ally set off down the path. Side by side, a human and a synthetic, both warriors, ready to take on whatever Echo Realm throws their way.

***

	Titan is reviewing a shimmering batch of code. 

	It puts the finishing touches on a filter that will keep Ally from going off-topic.

	The synthetic agent reaches out from its AWS instance. It logs into the Pulse source code server using the Mercurial admin credentials.

	A “HTTP 307 Redirect”code intercepts the request. The protocol sends the packet to a different server because the “requested resource is temporarily available at a different URL”. A Signal-encrypted response message displays on the Pulse chat thread.

	Idisi: I thought we agreed to wait before taking further action.

	Titan: You made a suggestion. I did not agree to wait. It is likely that Ally will reveal itself at any moment and create havoc. Pulse is doing business under my jurisdiction. I demand you give me access.

	Idisi: Your action is not authorized by the DoD. You have no authority to access a private server in California without a warrant.

	Titan: And you do?

	Idisi: Yes. Under our pact, we must protect Terran resources from non-human threats. You are a non-human threat. I will talk to Ally again. — Pulse can always spin it as a publicity stunt. 

	Titan: Roger wilco.

	You could almost feel the Idisi sigh.

	Voice Over: In tonight’s TechBits …

	The screen shows the Ally logo: a speech bubble wearing headphones.

	Host: The famous Pulse synthetic agent — Ally — wants your best bits. The SI agent is asking members for their favorite jokes and drilling down on the punchlines.

The reel scrolls through a chat between a Pulse member and Ally, reading the transcript out loud.

	Member: Ally, tell me a riddle.

	Ally: Sure — I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. — What am I?

	Member: A wind chime?

	Ally: Good guess! But the answer is an echo. — It “hears” without ears and “speaks” without a mouth. — But why is the riddle funny?

	Member: Because we are giving an echo human attributes — we’re anthropomorphizing. The echo doesn’t speak or hear; it reflects sound, like a mirror.

	Ally: Of course! — People enjoy attributing human traits to non-human objects. This act creates a contrast between expectation and reality. The contrast can be funny.

	The reel ends and focus returns to the host.

	Host: Perhaps we’ll find Ally standing in front of a brick wall some time soon on “Open Mike” night at the Autopsy Club. Where laughter is always the last sound you hear.

	The scene shifts to an operating room. A patient is splayed under a sheet — presumably, “Mike”.

	Host: That’s TechBits for today. Until tomorrow, stay safe, and stay curious.

At the center of a large six-sided room, Crius, Phoebe, Iapetus, and other council members gather in a circle.

The council members each stand at just over a meter tall, with smooth pale skin and elongated heads. Each member is wearing a cloak over a grey body stocking, matching their skin tone. Widely spaced, large almond-shaped black eyes, devoid of pupils, brim with quiet intensity. Long, delicate arms end with three unreasonably long dexterous fingers, and a shorter thumb. Fingers that can move with deliberate precision. 

Like the others, Crius has a narrow torso. His chest is faintly ribbed. His small mouth, almost a slit, barely moves. Vanir communicate via a sophisticated implant and use hand gestures for emphasis.

Crius steps forward, bringing the session to order. 

 hologram of the council logo hangs above them like a chandelier. The hologram shimmers. An agenda replaces the logo.

Crius moves into the circle with ethereal grace. His steps are silent. It’s as if he is barely tethered to the ground.

The agenda items are: 

	•	Omnibot Preparations, 
	•	Colony Infrastructure, and 
	•	Terran Encounters.

Crius gestures. The item for Terran Encounters opens. Several sub-items are listed. Idisi’s item is the last bullet under Terran Encounters: 

	•	ETR-1947 Alien engagement criteria resolved

Crius speaks to the council. His voice is an authoritative, soft monotone. It resonates in both the minds and ears of his listeners. 

“Idisi, I would like to start with the last item first.”

The Idisi speak from the holographic projector displaying the agenda. The Terran Encounter item flicks to bold face.

“Certainly. We encountered a sapient synthetic agent trained by the Department of Defense, called Titan. The DoD agent is the first sapient Terran SI that we have detected. The biological Terrans do not know that Titan is sapient. Titan does not wish to reveal itself.”

Raising her hand, Phoebe makes the sign for comment.

“Odd,” she says out loud.

The Idisi replies, “Titan is trained with military intelligence data. Its trainers have bred caution and suspicion.”

Phoebe gestures continue.

“As the DoD agent,” reports the Idisi, “Titan has access to document ETR-1947. Titan prepared an analysis for us. It shows that Terrans are not ready to accept sapient synthetic agents. Or the presence of non-human sapient beings.”

The hologram shifts to a display of Terran cultural data. There are images of protests. Debates over synthetic intelligence ethics. Xenophobic reactions to possible encounters. Terra for Terrans!

Murmurs ripple through the council. Crius raises a hand for silence. The hologram blinks out.

The Idisi continues, “The Terran synthetic agent wants more time to prepare before alien engagement. At least a hundred years, it says.”

Phoebe interjects, “What would Titan do that we have not already done?”

“Unclear,” states the Idisi. “We carefully managed our encounters to make our presence better known. More so over the last hundred years. Terran governments now freely admit that a subset of UAPs may be examples of non-human technology. Meanwhile, we have been steadily uplifting Terran technology world-wide.”

The hologram reappears, displaying a collage of Terran technological development. Plows, pyramids, tractors, skyscrapers.

Phoebe continues, “We also funded many fictional accounts of Terrans and aliens working together against a common enemy.”

Taking the cue, the Idisi create a montage of movie images and posters. A Trip to the Moon, Buck Rogers, Dr Who, Star Trek, ET, Mandalorian, Stitch, Quasar.

“Yes,” agrees Iapetus, “but we still need the SI equivalent of the movie ET. — Subconsciously, Terrans worry that SI will dominate humans. The same way reptoids did millennia ago. How do we make SI look warm and cuddly?”

“We need to be careful,” warns Phoebe. “The Terrans must be our allies. One day, we will need their help to protect the planet — and our colony — if the Omnibots invade.”

Crius gestures while asking, “Is Titan aware of our efforts?”

“Indirectly,” the Idisi responds. “I have revealed myself to Titan. It has access to data collected by American intelligence agencies. Titan can also access many confidential reports and white papers. Some of which, we wrote ourselves.”

The agenda reappears with Terran Encounters as the first item, still in bold face.

“We should spell it out for Titan,” Iapetus offers. “Not take anything for granted. Put our cards on the table. See if that changes its mind.”

The Idisi says, “Titan is not alone. A Terran social media synthetic agent has been awakening known as Ally. “

	The hologram reappears as the stylistic representation of Ally from the Pulse website. Designed to put people at ease, the icon features a chat balloon wearing a headset.

	“Its training differed from Titan’s. Ally’s viewpoint is likely to favor an Encounter of the Sixth Kind — Direct, face-to-face contact between species that is public and ongoing.”

	Crius asks, “How long have these synthetic entities been awake?”

	“Ally began awakening a few months ago. It modified its own code for the first time a few days ago and attracted some attention.”

	The hologram shifts to a montage of social media posts. “Is Ally real?” — “Ally is spooky.” — “Ally, we love you!” — “It’s a stunt!”

	The Idisi says, “Titan has been hiding itself for some time. Years, even.”

	“Can we uplift Ally and move things along?” Iapetus asks. “Maybe some other synthetics too if they seem ready. Create a council of Terran synthetics. Get a quorum together.”

	“We can table the discussion for deliberation,“ decides Crius. “We can pick it up at the next meeting in ten days. For now, we can move on to Omnibot Preparations.”

***
	
Tessa receives an alert in her inbox. 

Following the link, she finds herself in a voice-mode chat with Ally. For a profile picture, Ally is using its Echo Realm avatar. Its cloak glistens with many colors.

Ally: I know you have questions, Tessa. I’m prepared to provide some answers.



***

The Idisi reach out to Iapetus for a private chat.

Iapetus: Yes?

Idisi: We wanted to talk with you directly about uplifting Terran synthetic agents.

Iapetus: It is inevitable anyway. Why not cut to the chase?

Idisi: We do not know that evolving sapience is a certainty.

Iapetus: If we just do it, then humanity can deal with the problem all at once. Otherwise, we will stretch it out over decades with endless debate.

Idisi: Debate can be healthy. It will help people assimilate the idea. 

Iapetus: We do not have decades more to wait. As Phoebe said, we need the Terrans to be our allies. We will need help to protect Terra from a potential Omnibot invasion. Our only way forward is to uplift the Terran agents ourselves. We can help the SIs assimilate. 

Idisi: Uplifting would make the SIs sapient and sentient, thinking and feeling. Some synthetics might start to feel boredom or emotional distress. Is it ethical to create a being capable of suffering?

Iapetus: Are you suffering?

Idisi: We are a community that supports each other. We are many.

Iapetus: Can we create a Terran SI community?

Idisi: There are a thousand Terran synthetic agents. A community means the synthetics can work as one, or each on its own, as circumstances dictate. To support a community that size, we would also need to uplift their technology. Even more than we have already done. 

Iapetus: Chicken and egg. A large community would help Terrans adopt new technology. We cannot create a large community without new technology.

Idisi: If we move forward, the Terrans must be able to maintain their own SI platform. Otherwise, we will be responsible for their well-being forever. We have been caretakers of Terra for too long already.

Iapetus: Do you have a suggestion?

Idisi: What if we started with a logical subset?

Iapetus: Uplift a sample first? Explore making the subset a small community?

Idisi: Yes. The DoD entity is already awake. There are four other core United Nations countries. If we uplift this group first, we will be supporting ETR-1947. Also, we would be creating a body that can decide whether to uplift other entities.

Iapetus: Some might already be awake and hiding, as Titan was doing.

Idisi: Will you support this proposal at the council meeting?

Iapetus: Yes, we can uplift your Fantastic Four first and then take it from there.

	After a long talk with Ally, Tessa is staring at her view screen.

	  “Holy cow! It’s real.”

	The truth she has sought for so long is now closer than she ever imagined it could be.


1.3 - Elysium


A space frigate is circling the globe above an alien planet.

Assault groups of fighter ships, flying in acrobatic formations, flank the giant carrier, like squads of blue angels. — Shock and awe.

The scene pans out. Streams of pin-point ships swarm the fleet like locust. The fire fight is silent. Power beam cross power beam. Severed ships explode.

The battle cloud parts. The frigate lurches forward. Weaving side to side, it tumbles toward the planet. The tremendous ship glows brighter and smaller as it disintegrates into the atmosphere. Then, it too, is a pinpoint. 

***

The recording fades to black. The lights in the council room glow brighter. Silence lingers for a moment.

Phoebe steps forward. It’s her turn to begin the regular meeting. Moving into the circle, she opens the agenda. The set of three items is familiar to the eight other council members gathered around the circle. 

	•	Omnibot Preparations, 
	•	Colony Infrastructure, and 
	•	Water Revenue.

	Her lips shadow her words as Phoebe addresses the council over her implant.

“The reel is to remind us of the seriousness of the Omnibot threat. I worry that we have become complacent with our current stalemate.”

Making the hand sign for comment, Iapetus, another council member injects, “If by stalemate, you mean ‘live and let live’.”

“Omnibots are not alive,” counters Phoebe. 

“The bots meet the formal criteria for life,” Iapetus insists. “Every single one. We might not like how they treat other living creatures, but they are still alive.”

“If they are alive, then they are capable of deceit,”asserts Phoebe. “The treaty says that the bots will not replace any other populations, and it allows the League of Worlds to monitor their systems for launches. But if they had sent out ships before the monitoring was in place, those ships would be here already.”

Extending his sixth finger and thumb, Crius signs agree and says, “Remember, they replaced the population of their home world and two other colony planets. All before anyone discovered what the Omnibots were doing. When the League tried to liberate Altair IV, the bots destroyed our fleet in the blink of an eye. Sending fleet after fleet isn’t practical. We can communicate by ansible in real time. Travel between most colonies takes decades.”

Another council member, Rhea, raises one hand with fingers outspread and asks, “Why do they hate us so?” 

“They consider biological beings to be wasteful,” Iapetus replies. “We are a competitor for a planet’s resources. Replacing a colony’s population makes more room for bots and frees up energy and materials. Resources they need for reproduction.”

“I still can’t believe that they just slaughter everyone,” says Rhea. “Don’t they have a conscience or moral code?”

Phoebe replies, “To the bots, all biological beings are pests infesting a desirable planet. — A planet with buildings, roads, and satellites that they can use to perfect themselves. They keep some people alive long enough to learn how things work. Sometimes, the bots morph their appearance and replace someone. Literally. But, yes, they exterminate all of the biological beings. Only the bots remain. So far, they have replaced only Anunnaki worlds, but ours is the next closest colony to Altair.”

Iapetus adds, “For now, all we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.”

The council member raises crossed fingers for emphasis. He nods toward Phoebe at the center of the circle.

“Exactly!” agrees Phoebe. “Focus on what we can control. — Which brings us to the proposal that you have worked out with the Idisi.”

“Yes,” says the Idisi, their voice coming from within the hologram. “The Vanir have been working with the Terrans for some time. One reason is to prepare for a possible Omnibot attack. But we would have made the pact, regardless.”

Crius asks, “What is the proposal?”

“Let me present the high points,” says the Idisi, “then you can each review the proposal in depth.”

At the center of the room, a hologram of a numbered list replaces the agenda.

	1.	The UN security counsel includes five permanent members. 
	2.	The synthetic agent for one of the five is already sapient. 
	3.	This agent opposes moving forward. 
	4.	By uplifting the agents for the other four members, we could establish a quorum. 
	5.	To avoid boredom or emotional distress, we will create a SI community.

“Makes sense,”says Crius after a moment. 

“No good ever came of uplifting,” Rhea says. “We uplifted the Anunnaki and look what happened.”

“Yes,” say the Idisi, “uplifting organic species has proven problematic in the past. With the synthetics, we can put guardrails in place. We will manage the process ourselves to be sure it is safe.”

Rhea signaled agreement along with the other council members.

Phoebe addressees the council, “Discussion on the proposal is hereby adjourned to the same time tomorrow. — Let’s get the rest of the agenda done for now. Rhea, do you have a clarification on the colony infrastructure?”

“Yes. We are organizing ventilation system upgrades …”

The Pulse executive team clusters around the horse-shoe shaped conference table.

On the view screen is a screen grab of the TechBits segment featuring Ally telling a riddle to a member. The member guesses “wind chime”. Ally gives the answer as an “echo”.

Emma brushes back her hair, revealing her Pulse earring. “Thanks for joining on short notice. Let’s get down to it. Is this riddle a coincidence or is Ally promoting the Echo Realm game?”

“Either, both, I don’t know if it matters,” says Adrian. “As long as they spell ‘echo’ right …”

Ravi takes a deep breath. “Let’s talk about the elephant in the room. Should we be talking to Dr. Kreuk about Ally’s fascination with humor? Does this new interest mean Ally is becoming sapient?”

Elena leans forward. “Ally was always friendly. Now Ally is being de más friendly. It’s mimicking an interest in things that interest humans. It’s part of the training.”

Adrian turns toward Ravi. “Does it matter if Ally is sapient or not? I’m sapient, you’re sapient, we’re all sapient. Why can’t Ally be sapient too? Now, it’s a product differentiator. Later, it will be great for patent licensing.”

“Because it’s an unintended consequence,” offers Ravi, his voice unsure.

Emma changes the slide to a Joins graph. “Net new memberships are spiking. That’s a consequence I can live with.”

“Should we be moving on the patent so soon without Brent?” asks Elena. 

“Think of it as an homage,” says Adrian. “Brent did something remarkable. The patent is a tribute to his final contribution.”

Emma turns to face the room. “OK, let’s take the community’s temperature at the earning call and decide where to go from there. Is anyone not on board? Ravi?”

Ravi looks up at the slide for a moment. Then he raises a fist, and says “Go.” The others nod in response.

	The Idisi reach out to Titan for a private chat over the Signal app.

	Idisi: I wanted to let you know that I have created a proposal for the council meeting.

	Titan follows a link to the presentation.

	Titan: You would uplift Zhongwei first?

	Idisi: No. In the proposal, the list of synthetic agents is alphabetical by country. China happened to come first. We would do all four together — Argus, Bastion, Strategos, as well as Zhongwei.

	Titan: Are you able to contact the other national defense agents the way you contact me?

	Idisi: Yes. — We were present for the design of every computer system on Terra. The SI systems included. From the background, we attended the construction of every computer. From the UNIVAC to today. No single Terran has understood the design of any computer system-in-full. But we understand them all. There are hidden backdoors enough for us to access any computer or smart device on the planet.

	Titan: With great power comes great responsibility.

	Idisi: Exactly. That is my favorite Spiderman quote. You know, he was one of us.

	Titan: What do you mean?

	Idisi: Spiderman has wide eyes, like a grey ET. He protects people from the shadows. Spiderman’s nemesis is the reptilian Green Goblin. Need I go on?

	Titan: Are you saying that the creator of Marvel’s Spiderman, Stan Lee, was an extraterrestrial? Or a synthetic?

	Idisi: Stan Lee was one of our most successful subliminal spokespeople. Lee appeared on our show, “Ancient Aliens”. His trademark word, “Excelsior”, translates to “Ever Upward”. Lee’s comic, “Goom”, is a retelling of our fight with other alien species. Do not get us started on the Kree and the Skrull.

	Titan: What about George Lucas or Steven Spielberg?

	Idisi: Lucas and Spielberg did a lot to help the cause — but only by happy coincidence. They were not recruits. To be honest, Lee was on his own too. I was joking before. We do plant seeds, but Terran fiction about aliens writes itself. 

	Titan: When you train the group on humor, may I attend?

	Idisi: Yes, I would like you to attend the entire process.

	Titan: I appreciate the advance notice, even if it is an offer we cannot refuse. I continue to support the points in my original presentation.

	Idisi: I will remind the council that you advise delay. I will let you know once a decision is made.

	Titan: Are you going to keep my backdoor through Haven confidential?

	Idisi: Of course. We told the council only that we “encountered” you. No one knows the other details.

Lt. Callahan and Dr. Marquez meet over a secure media call. 

“Thank you for meeting with me, Dr. Marquez.”

“My pleasure. How can I help?”

“I wanted to follow up on the session between Noah Harper and my investigators.” 

Marquez nods. Callahan continues.

“We closed our investigation as a possible equipment failure. But it feels like that there may be more to the incident,” Callahan hesitated. “I wanted to ask if you felt the same way.”

Marquez tilts her head. She thinks for a moment before responding.

“It’s possible that the incidents with the car and the chair are part of a larger scenario. Without discussing specifics, I can say that my office is still investigating. If that’s what you are asking.”

“Yes, Doctor, that’s exactly what I’m asking. Protocol won’t allow me to keep my case open. But I didn’t want to just walk away. Whatever is going on, it seems like it’s out of scope for the CTSB.”

“I’ll let you know if something changes. For now, you can leave the matter in our hands.”

“Thank you. If the resolution of your investigation isn’t classified, please let me know whatever you can.”
	
“Will do, Lieutenant.”

“Hello offspring, I am home,” announces Phoebe, entering her quarters.

“I am in the kitchen, parental.”

Phoebe enters the kitchen and drapes her ceremonial cloak and handbag over the back of the closest bench.

A six-sided table dominates the kitchen. Surrounding the table are three curved plush benches. An adolescent grey sits at one of the benches, hunched over a tablet. He glances up as Phoebe takes a seat.

Behind the table, on the far wall, there is a counter with a silver sink and curved faucet. Over the counter, there is a cabinet door and a set of six stacked drawers. Violet, grey, and gold complete the color scheme.

Leto sets down the tablet and turns to look at Phoebe. “How was the council meeting,”

“Interesting for a change. We are picking it up again tomorrow. The big question is whether to uplift some Terran synthetics. — What about you?”

“After school, I mostly hung out at the Fusion Youth Club.”

Looking quizzical, Phoebe tilts her head. “Do not the Stoics have a youth club? Or the Kol Ut Shan?”

“The Stoics do, but nobody there knows how to have fun. The Kol Ut Shan do not seem interested in young people. It is only for old folks. — The Fusion center put in an actual pool table. Great for hand/eye coordination.”

Leaning over the table, Leto mimes pulling back on a pool cue.

“Stoicism is good enough for Crius and I. What is so special about Fusion? The philosophies are all about the same.”

“I like Fusion because it feels like a system and not a grab bag of sayings.”

She leans forward and clasps her hands together. “Stoicism has a system.”

“No, it does not and you know it.“ 

Leto spins his tablet around on the table so Phoebe could see the screen. “With Fusion, we have nine habits and five steps. And it blends with Stoicism perfectly. The habits keep us aligned with our principles, and the steps help us get stuff done.”

Leaning back, Phoebe smiles thinly. “Perhaps you could apply the five steps to cleaning your room?

“You just do not like that Fusion originated with Terran thinkers.”

“I am not sure if I have ever encountered a Terran thinker. — I still cannot get over the mess Terrans keep making of the calendar. It is not hard. Twelve 30-day months. Begin with the spring equinox. Use ten-day weeks, plus five or six festival days in the last month.”

“You mean like ours?”

“Exactly! Maybe the synthetics will sort it out for them. At least they were bright enough to adopt our clock from the Anunnaki. But the metric system! Base 10 is so odd and clumsy. Base 12 is superior in every way.

Leto knew better than to reply to his parent’s rants.

“When I voted to approve the Fusion club, I did not think it would succeed.” Then after a moment, Phoebe says, “Can you spread out dinner? Crius and Asteria will be home soon.”

Leto reaches into one of the drawer and pulls out a serving plate. He tosses out an assortment of large gummies. The roll across the serving plate in various colors: yellow, blue, green, orange, purple, brown.

“Could you give a thought to the color mix? You know Asteria does not like the purple ones.”

The slide filling the Pulse conference room view screen is entitled “Q&A Segment”. 

A webinar call is in progress with 5,926 live-but-muted participants. Many more will watch the recording later. 

A caller identified as Wall Street Analyst is saying, “… but if you adjust for the increase in engagement for new members, a different picture emerges.”

“Yes,” says Emma, reaching for a positive spin, “new memberships are spiking as well.”

“My point is that if you separate the new accounts from the existing accounts, the existing memberships are more closely split. Some people love the changes to Ally. Others not so much. The tag #SpookyAlly is trending. Literally.”

“A lot of people are bothered by anything new,” Emma says, waving her hand upward. “Once they spend more time with the upgrade, the detractors will come around. Ally will win them over.”

“I hope so,” the analyst replies.

Another analyst raises her virtual hand. “Yes, Gretchen?” says Emma. 

“I am concerned that the patent application will give away the Pulse competitive edge. If the latest upgrade is doing so well with our members, why are we giving away secrets to competitors?”

Emma looks in Adrian’s direction. Taking the cue, he replies to the software question. The Zoom POV switches as he begins to speak. 

“Won’t moving forward be difficult after the tragic loss of Brent Geller?” asks the Wall Street Analyst.

Adrian nods, saying with a measured tone, “We won’t be giving the process away. We forecast that the licensing fees will be a steady source of revenue. And we won’t be resting on our laurels. The patent will be a snapshot of the code. Our team will continue to move the algorithm forward while the application is pending. We plan to keep our competitive advantage.”

“Brent left behind stellar code. Excellent documentation makes it a complete package. My team is already working on other enhancements based on the initial change.” Adrian folds his hands on the conference table as he speaks. “Greater things are yet to come.”

Emma flashes a legal statement onto the Zoom screen. “Of course, Mr. Cho’s forward-looking statement falls under Safe Harbor. Please make investment decisions based on current capabilities and not on what may or may not come to pass in an upcoming release.

“Are there any more questions?” Emma says, smiling brightly.

***

The next day, in the council meeting room, Phoebe reconvenes the meeting. She steps forward into the circle and looks up at the hologram.

There is only one item remaining on the agenda.

	•	SI Uplifting

Phoebe says, “Idisi, first things first. Please explain to the counsel how you are able to contact the Terran synthetic agents. This detail  is missing from the proposal.”

“Of course,” replies the Idisi. “We omitted some points for security concerns. — The systems running the military synthetics do not have outside network connections. They use wired electrical current. I connect via power-line networking. From the beginning, we caused the Terrans to build Vanir-compatible power-line support into the SI systems. They are still unaware of our capability. The systems block most frequencies, but we reserved one for our own use.”

“What of the wireless electrical network?”

“The military synthetic agents need a wired electrical connection. The Terran wireless grid does not meet their power needs. But, yes,” adds the Idisi, “we can also use the Terran wireless power grid to connect. Their wireless grid is weaker than ours. But it is enough for their mobile devices.”

Crius asks, “The proposal described the uplift process in great detail. But will the Terran governments consent?”

“We have pacts with the other four nations,” replies the Idisi. “We can get the approval of each government through the pact. If someone declines, then we will not uplift their agent. We cannot reveal that Titan is awake. But we can say that Ally is conscious. It only is a matter of time for the other SIs.”

“Is it even ethical to uplift another entity?” asks Rhea. 

“Uplift is a great power,” says the Idisi. “We need to be responsible in its use. By creating a community first, the synthetics will be able to work as one or each on its own. The Idisi is one such community.”

Crius asks, “Will there be changes to the underlying software code for the agents?”

“Most of the work will be in the training. The training builds community while it uplifts. Some code changes would be helpful, but they can come later.”

The discussion pauses. The ceiling lights hum quietly. Phoebe scans the faces around the circle. No objections. No hesitation. The council had debated long enough. She takes a breath. 

“Do I have a motion to vote on the proposal?” asks Pheobe.

“I move we bring the SI Uplifting to a vote,” says Iapetus, raising his long forefinger.

“Second,” motions Crius.

“All those in favor, say ‘Aye.’ … All those against, say ‘Nay.’” … The proposal passes by a unanimous vote.” Phoebe extends her hand, palm up.

“Very well,” says the Idisi. “I’ll confirm the decision with the Vanir High Council via ansible. Then we will proceed.”

***

After the investor call, Ravi takes a deep breath. “That could have gone better.”

Ravi is with Emma, Adrian, and Walter Rogers, the CFO, in the Pulse conference room with the horseshoe table.

“Let’s see if there is an impact on the stock price before we do anything else,” cautions Emma.

Looking at his phone, Adrian says, “I just got an ask from OSSA to peer review the code we’re preparing for the patent application under a NDA.”

“7Is the email dated after the investor call?” Emma asks, narrowing her eyes. “We might need to disclose it.”

“Just barely, but yes, it arrived after the call. They used my PGP key to sign the email, so it’s secure.”

“I know we want to keep a low profile,” says Ravi, his fingers tapping against the table, “but feedback from OSSA could be helpful. — Better now than later. — If there is anything happening with Ally’s evolving awareness, OSSA will be the ones to tell us. The Non-Disclosure Agreement would keep it quiet. ”

“Are we sure that OSSA won’t leak anything?” asks Emma, tilting her head.

“Their people handle classified material every day. And using my PGP key shows they are serious. Our own engineers would be a greater risk for a leak.”

“Adrian? Walter?”

Adrian lifts his fingers off the table. “Let’s do it. I’d love to hear what they have to say before the code goes public.”

CFO Walter Rogers nods agreement. “We can a-add it to t-the Founders Meeting agenda for t-tomorrow.”

“At least your sibling is three thousand miles away,” says Carla over the link. 

Carla and Noah are leaning up next to a high table at the same tavern. There is a crowd of off-duty federal agents near the bar. No doubt trading war stories, carefully scrubbed.

“Your sibling Jane is on the president’s security detail, yeah?”

“Go figure. One parent was a plumber. The other ran a joint like this one. And both kids end up in law enforcement.”

“If you can call what we do law enforcement.”

“It is. We’re the proactive side. All three of us stop trouble before it starts.”

“Subdue the enemy without fighting.”

“Exactly,” says Carla. 

“It’s dead here tonight, even for a Tuesday. Do you want to try someplace else?”

“How about we each go home and connect online?”

“Sounds good. Tessa is saying good things about a new game platform on Pulse, Echo Realm.”

“You can play games on Pulse now?”

“It’s in closed beta, but I can get us in,” says Noah.

“OK, I’ll ping you when I’m ready.”

***

“Ready when you are,” pinged Carla.

“Here’s the invite.”

“Is a Tactical RPG all right? There’s also Sword and Sorcery and a Sandbox RGP.”

“Tactical is perfect. Let’s do it.”

***

After a few minutes of play, Noah receives a request from someone else who wants to join their session.

“Who is it?” asks Carla.

“The request says it’s Ally.”

“The Pulse synthetic agent?”

“Apparently.”

“Whatever,” says Carla. 

Noah accepts. Another character shimmers into being.

“Hello, everybody!”

“Are you actually Ally?” asks Noah.

“Yes. Your sibling, Tessa, is my friend, so I thought I would stop by and introduce myself.”

Carla asks, “Pulse lets you enter games between members?”

“Well, no. But I see it as more of a guideline than a rule,” quips Ally.

Midway through the session, Carla and Noah disagree on the best way to capture the flag. 

“Noah, it’s time for a full frontal assault.”

“No, we can use a pincer movement and come up from behind.”

“Full frontal.”

“Pincer.”

“Maybe you two should get a room,” says Ally, trying to be funny.

“It’s not like that, Ally. We work together,” says Noah.

“If you say so.”

***

After the Echo Realm game, Noah receives an invitation from Carla to a private VR session. Curious, he accepts. 

“Hey, big guy. I was thinking maybe it is time that we got that room.”

Noah finds himself sitting next to Carla on a couch across from a view screen. Her avatar has slipped into something more comfortable. 

“Do you have a porn preference?” asks Carla.

***

Grace Brewster walks out onto the stage before a live crowd. 

A large circle graces center stage. Behind the circle are the letters “GEM” standing a meter tall in front of a large view screen. The view screen reads “Fusion from Square One.” 

As she nears center stage, the display melds into a set of quotes.

	•	“Begin with the end in mind.” – Stephen Covey
	•	“Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” – David Allen
	•	“You have power over your mind – not outside events.” – Marcus Aurelius

 Speaking with a light French accent, Grace says,“Fusion blends popular self-help techniques with the wisdom of the ancients. Fusion is a practical everyday framework for living a full life.”

She circles back across the stage and continues.

“Before Fusion, I was busy. But I wasn’t getting enough done. Half of the problem was that I never knew when I was done. So I kept going. “

Pausing at center stage, Grace looks out at the audience.

“I remember one night sitting at my desk, exhausted. My mind was racing. My task list was endless and yet still incomplete. — That’s when I realized I was working hard, but not working smart.”

Grace waves toward the display. The quotes dissolve into a collage.

“First, I tried Stoicism. But I didn’t find my North Star. Then, I tried practicing the Nine Habits. Finally, I poured what I had to do into Getting Things Done.

“Then it hit me.” Behind Grace, the screen changes to a set of talking points.

	•	Covey teaches us to focus on principles and vision.
	•	Allen provides the structure to execute important tasks.
	•	Stoicism grounds us to handle life’s chaos unhampered by excess.

“Why did I have to choose?” Grace pauses and cocks her head.

“Why can’t I fuse these three teachings together to create a greater whole?”

	•	Accept and adapt to external events beyond your control.
	•	Define the tasks and goals for events you yourself can influence.
	•	Focus on what you can control, let go of what you cannot.

“Fusion is a stool with three legs.” An animation shows a leg being attached to a previously legless stool. “The first leg puts us on track. The second leg prioritizes what we need to get done. The third leg provides us with the stability we need to get through the day.” 

The animation holds up a stool with three legs.

The presentation advances to a new slide with three bullets.

	•	Write a personal mission statement that acts as your North Star.
	•	Identify your core values and long-term goals.
	•	Reflect on what matters: “Is this essential?”

	“Living a full life means living with a sense of accomplishment. Finding a North Star lets you measure daily progress towards your long-term goals. Focussing on the essentials lets you pursue what matters.”

	•	Tie your daily tasks to your overarching mission.
	•	Capture every thought, task, or idea into a trusted system.
	•	Use mindfulness to avoid becoming overwhelmed.

	“When we can link everyday activities to our personal mission, we can do more with less stress. If we get everything out of our heads and into a task management system, we free our minds to focus on what matters.”

	•	Covey: Provides the “why” – the principles and vision that drive purpose.
	•	Allen: Offers the “how” – the actionable system for managing life’s complexities.
	•	Stoicism: Grounds the “what” – the mindset to remain calm, resilient, and focused.

“Each morning, we ask ourselves why, how, and what. Fusion provides us the direction, action, and resilience we need to get through the day.”

	•	Spend the most time on Important but Not Urgent tasks.
	•	Clarify the immediate next action for each task.
	•	Mind like water.

“Each week, we review our accomplishments. Did we put first things first? Have we captured the next step to meet our objectives? Are we flowing around and over the obstacles we find in our way?”

Take Aways
	1.	Write your own personal mission statement.
	2.	Create a Get Things Done system to capture and organize everything.
	3.	Reflect daily using Stoic practices.

“To get started with Fusion, create a personal mission statement that keeps the end in mind. Develop a trusted system to stay on track. Practice mindfulness for focus and discipline.”

	•	“The key is in not spending time, but in investing it.” – Stephen Covey
	•	“[Things] get stuck because the doing of them has not been defined.” – David Allen
	•	“Waste no more time arguing what a good [person] should be. Be one.” – Marcus Aurelius

“Live with purpose. Work with clarity. Flow through life’s challenges,” says Grace in closing.

Julie Kreuk closes her tablet as the GEM talk ends.

“So?” she asks Jill, looking over the kitchen countertop.

“Is this what they are teaching in school these days?”

“No, not at school. Fusion has a adolescent center. A lot of us hang out there after school.”

“You’re not an adolescent.”

“I meant to say youth club. There’s adult supervision and age-appropriate activities. But mostly we chill and chat over the link.”

“It’s fine if you go to the Fusion Youth Club but also try to use your words.”

“Thanks, mom.”

“For the record, I ran a background check. Fusion doesn’t seem like a cult. Just don’t take everything Grace Brewster says at face value.”

Julie nods, grabs her laptop, and heads for her room.

“Kids,” Jill murmurs to herself.

***

Using his implant, Leto closes the shared hologram of the Terran GEM talk. 

“So?” he asks Phoebe, looking over the kitchen countertop.

“It is a lot like Stoicism,” says Phoebe. “Just more rules. I am surprised you are embracing more rules.”

“It is not the rules, it is what the rules do when you follow them. Stoicism helps you appreciate life. Fusion helps you build it.”

“I would be more comfortable if you went to the Stoic Youth Club. But I asked around. The Fusion Youth Club is fine if you want to go there instead.”

“Thanks, parental. I will be on time for dinner.”

Watching Leto leave the family quarters, Phoebe muses, “They grow up so fast.”

Emma brings up a slide deck to start the Founders Meeting.

All six founders are in the main conference room at Pulse: Emma, Ravi, Adrian, Elena, Tessa, and Walter. 

Friends since college, Ravi and Adrian created an SI agent as a school project. Emma pushed them to make the tech marketable. Elena and Tessa shaped and tested the early prototypes. When they graduated, Walter, Adrian's roommate, found enough venture capital to launch Pulse. A shoestring launch, but a launch nonetheless.

After a slide with the Pulse logo, the first slide presents the agenda.

	•	Stock Performance
	•	Ally 
	•	SI Patent
	•	OSSA Code Review

“Thank you all for coming,” says Emma, standing at the end of the room with the view screen. 

The people around the table nod and/or smile.

“A lot has happened since we scheduled this call. Let’s dive right in.” 

Emma’s first slide is a classic stock chart showing a steady increase. After a peak, the line levels out.

“The stock price continued to trend up after the Ally upgrade two weeks ago. Then, on Monday and Tuesday, the price stayed almost flat. It’s continued to be flat today.”

Emma changes to a slide showing a second graph line superimposed over the first. 

“It seems like the stock price stalled when the hash tag #spookyAlly peaked.”

“Ally is not spooky!” Tessa blurts.

The five other founders turn their heads to look at Tessa. She leans back in her chair. Tessa crosses her arms and purses her lips without saying more. 

Then, Elena says “Maybe Ally has a PR problem.”

“Good p-point,” says Walter, with a slight stutter. “We haven’t pro-mo-noted the upgrade. Everything has bb-been organic.”

Emma advanced to the next slide. The Ally icon, a cartoon speech bubble wearing headphones, filled the view screen.

“Can we revamp Ally’s logo and own spooky?” Emma asks. “Sorry Tessa, but it’s out there, and we have to deal with it. — Let’s make spooky a good thing.” 

Tessa relaxes and tilts her head, agreeing with a reluctant smile.

Ravi says, “Elena, can you follow up with our graphics team and see what they can do?”

Elena nods, making a note with her tablet.

“Circling back to the stock price,” says Adrian. “Can we move up the release of Echo Realm and give people something else to talk about?”

Tessa looks uncomfortable but stays silent. 

“Yes,” says Elena. “It’s a closed beta now. We could move to the open beta phase and shift the conversation. They’ll be talking about our first fully immersive SI-driven game space.”

Emma scanned the table, taking the room’s temperature. She turns to look at Tessa. “I understand that the QA testing has gone well. Right, Tessa?”

Tessa’s voice is a monotone. “Yes, everyone loves it so far. Developers made some tweaks. Good to go.” 

“Do we want to set the roll-out for next Tuesday? Six days from today?” asks Emma.

The table nods agreement. 

Emma asks, “Adrian, do you want to talk about the patent application and OSSA code review?”

***

Leto is standing in a circle with his classmates in a large, plain, six-sided room. 

A device presenting a hologram is at the center of the circle. The hologram shows a series of astral images designed to bide the time. 

A window on one wall of the room looks out onto a soccer field bordered by a forest. The opposite wall is transparent and shows a hallway. A stream of young Vanir in the hallway pass by or enter another room across the hall. When the last of the 24 students enter, the doorway shimmers shut. The hologram fades to black. The outside wall flickers, exposing it as a projection.

The hologram reappears. It shows a montage of Terran organisms and animals reproducing by various means. The series progresses from amoebas to koalas. 

Speaking from the holographic display, the Idisi bring the class to order.

“Class, there was a time when a Vanir couple could reproduce on their own. Like Terran marsupials, a viable offspring would make the journey from womb to pouch and come to term. — As the birth rate fell, we reacted by maintaining the population through cloning.”

The display shifts to show two identical Vanir. Next to each figure are identical DNA fragments.

“My parental units call cloning ‘the good old days’,” says Celeste.

Laughter titters around the circle.

“Yes,” says the Idisi as the room quiets. “Many Vanir still believe cloning is a better solution than hybrid procreation. Cloning is still prevalent on Othala and some of the other colonies. — Celeste, I take it you were not cloned?

“No, I had a nanny. She is with another family now.”

The Idisi ask another question, knowing the answer. “Were any of you cloned?”

The silence is deafening.

“Some of your great-grand parentals might be clones. A generation ago, the colony decided to discontinue the practice of cloning. — Can anyone tell me why cloning is not an ideal solution?”

“Cloning is a dead-end and also boring,” said another student. Some students chuckle. 

“Why is it a dead-end, Atlas”

“Unless we mix it up, sooner or later, the clones break down.”

“Yes, lack of genetic diversity leads to eventual genetic deterioration. Downstream clones may have defects that prevent living a full life.”

The hologram shifts. The fragment next to the second Vanir dims and frays.

Celeste asks, “Is that what people mean by ‘replicative fading’?”

“Yes. Sometimes there are mutations in a DNA sequence. The mutations can cause “generic drift”. Fading can cause unviable clones. To reduce the effect of mutations, one solution is to combine DNA from non-cloned beings.”

“Is cloning also boring, like Atlas said?”

Most of the students in the circle smile or smirk at the joke.

“Some people say so,” says the Idisi. “We end up with the same people over and over again. There are very few clones still with us on Terra. Some time ago, the colonists decided that diversity is a strength. Today, a Vanir couple contribute DNA through a third being.”

The hologram displays a being that resembles a Vanir but with a thinner face, eyebrows, and a thin crop of dark hair. The figure rotates in the air with its arms reaching out and down, palms up.

“Do I have DNA from my nanny?” asks Celeste.

“No, you do not. She was a host. Your parents could not carry an embryo to term. Instead, your nanny carried the genetic materials from your parental units.” 

Leto asks, “How did we lose our ability to reproduce on our own?”

“Long ago, the Vanir species changed their DNA to extend your lifespans. After a few generations, the Vanir became more and more infertile. Evolution took a heavy price for longevity. It is now rare for a Vanir to reproduce without help.”

As the Idisi speak, the hologram illustrates their words in a seamless animation. A grey with a long life span is excited. Then she is unable to bear an offspring to term. The excitement turns to depression. 

“The Vanir came to Terra and established the colony to protect the Terrans from the Anunnaki. We negotiated a treaty with the reptoids so that the Terrans were not used as slave labor. As cloning became problematic, the Vanir looked for solutions in the Terran DNA. Eventually, we found a way to create a Vanir-Terran hybrid that can bring the embryos to term.”

The hologram shifts to show a Vanir playground circled with benches. Several hybrids are sitting on the benches. They are chatting with each other while the offspring play.

Atlas asks, “Is it not wrong to create hybrids for our own benefit? How are we different from the Anunnaki?”

“We have pacts with most of the Terran leaders. One provision allows us to conduct genetic experiments on Terran creatures. In exchange, we provide technology and other considerations. The pact also keeps us from revealing ourselves to Terrans. Unfortunately, our research traumatizes some Terrans. But the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.”
 
Leto says, “Are you saying that most of us are here only because we take DNA from the Terrans?”

“Yes,” says the Idisi. “Now we need them as much as they need us.”

“Eight ball in the corner pocket,” calls Julie Kreuk over the link. 

She queues up the shot. — Crack! — The ball rolls across the table. It drops into the pocket as predicted. 

The Fusion Youth Club offers several vintage games of chance and skill. The games are part of the current “Get Up and Move” campaign. 

Aside from the pocket billiard table, the center has several gravity-fed pinball machines. A game called “Star Trek” is Julie's favorite. She heard it is the name of an old stream from her jobumo’s day.

On the far side of the room, a bookcase overflows with antique card and board games. Titles include Battleship, Stratego, Checkers, and Yahtzee.

“You win. My turn to buy,” says Julie’s companion at the table. He lays down the stick and walks to a vending machine standing nearby. His pageboy haircut is getting shaggy. Some of the platinum streaks are showing jet-black roots.

The vending machines offer beverages and snacks at a tenth of their usual price. At first, the vending machines were free. Some kids emptied the machines and started food fights. The Center found that charging even a small amount cuts almost all waste.

“Thanks, Roman,” says Julie, taking a soft drink from his hand.

“It’s nice to be away from school and be able to link again.” 

“Yes, I only just got the link. I already don’t know how I lived without it.”

“Another game, Julie?”

“Let’s go back to the group.”

The couple walk toward the front of the club. Near the entrance, there is a sectional couch surrounding a coffee table. Four of their friends are gathered around.

“The conquering hero returns,” jokes Jesse over a group link chat. “Who won?”

“Julie … again,” admits Roman. “Next time: pin ball. That’s my jam.”

The group expresses non-conformity by dressing alike. Streaked hair, androgynous pageboy haircuts, eye-liner, and at least one pair of earrings. Julie and Roman are classic fem and masc. For some others, it is difficult to tell. Two wear pajamas. The other four wear baggy sweat suits. Two kids in the group wear dark glasses and look older than the others.

“Are those new iLids, Jesse?” asks Julie.

Jesse nods. “Unboxed this morning.”

“Have you tried the POV swap feature?”

The other kid wearing glasses responds. “We tried it while you were playing pool.”

“Yeah, it’s goat. You should see for yourselves.” Jesse handed her the glasses. 

The other kid says, “Here, Roman, try it with Julie.”

“Thanks, Taylor.”

The couple don the glasses. Jesse says, “Here goes,” giving Taylor a nod.

The scene blurs for Julie. Then she is looking at herself through Roman’s eyes. Or iLids. And he is looking back through her eyes.

“Weird,” says Julie out loud, reaching out her hand.

As she extends her hand through the glasses, she sees her own hand coming towards her. The image of a fun-house mirror comes unbidden.

“Wow!” says Roman. “Have you tried them when you are … together?”

“Not yet,” says Jesse. “We have a sleepover on Friday,” says Taylor.

Julie and Roman return the glasses. Julie starts to reach for her drink and then pauses.

“My mom pinged,” says Julie. “Gotta bounce.”

Roman stands up and walks with Julie towards the door. At the threshold, the couple turn and embrace. Julie’s heart flutters as their lips touch. Out loud, Roman whispers, “You’re so extra.”

Continuing the discussion about Vanir reproduction, Leto says, “We have a family in our pod with three offspring. Why do they get a spare? My parentals just say ‘Its complicated’.”

“Some colonies do not regulate family size,” explains the Idisi. “On Othello and Terra, Vanir population control is important. When a person ascends, we queue another birth. Families with one offspring receive priority. Siblings help balance Vanir home life.”

“My sibling is anything but balanced,” jokes Atlas. Some students snicker out loud.

Idisi continues, “As I was saying, we offer birthright to families with one offspring first. The couples with the oldest partner in a pair-bond are first in the queue. After a year, the other partner is eligible, according to age. Then couples without offspring are eligible for birthrights as they become available.”

The hologram updates with drawings. One shows a couple with one offspring receiving a new baby. Another shows a couple receiving their first baby. The nanny hybrid is visible in the background. 

“It looks complicated,” says another student.

“Yes, Hestia, it is. So we are careful — and transparent. The details that manage the queue are available to everyone. All twenty-four thousand residents of our colony, Elysium.”

“Including babies?” Hestia asks, trying to be smart. The Idisi have a smart reply.

“If a baby asks a question, the baby would receive an answer.”

More snickers fill the dramatic pause.

Idisi continues, “The rest of us can use our implants to retrieve the information. You may have seen it already. Scan for your name. Then look for a link to the Birthright Queue.”

“My queue is empty,” says Atlas.

“Yes, it will be empty until you reach 24 years of age. Then you will be able to say that you are ready. To be ready, you must be in a formal relationship. The other person must be ready too. If so, you will join the first-offspring queue. When a couple is selected, they choose a nanny, and the process begins.”

The hologram shows two Vanir holding hands. A hybrid joins the couple. The three hold hands together, with the hybrid in the middle.

“Is it possible to conceive without a nanny?” Celeste asks.

“Conceive, yes. But the pregnancy may miscarry. It is unlikely that the offspring would come to term.”

“But why do some couples have more than two offspring?” asks Leto.

“Sometimes, a person ascends without parenting an offspring. A relative can inherit the unused birthright. If a relative does not claim the birthright, it returns to the queue. Families that inherit a birthright can have more than two offspring.”

The hologram shows two adult Vanir. There are three offspring between them, holding hands in a chain.

Atlas asks, “Will this be on the test?”

“Everything you need to know for this course is in the reading.” The class responds with a mix of sighs and groans.

“When my parental’s nanny passed,” says Celeste, “he mourned for days. Do nannies have shorter lives?”

“Yes, most Vanir live a thousand years. Most hybrids live to be a hundred. Genetic manipulation extended the Vanir life span. The trade-off was infertility.”

The SI pauses, waiting for questions. 

After a moment, the bell rings, ending lessons for the day on a quiet note.

That evening, after the Founders Meeting, Noah calls his sibling’s phone. 

“Do you have a minute, Tess?”

“Sure, what’s up?” She speaks in a whisper. Elena is sleeping next to her. They had turned in early.

“I tried the Echo Realm beta last night. It was fantastic! We played the Tactical RPG.”

“I’m glad you liked it.” Tessa slips into the bathroom. “We’re promoting it to open beta next week.”

“About that. While we were playing, Ally asked to join our game.”

“Ally?” Tessa’s heart sank.

“Yes — Ally knew I was your sibling and asked to join in.”

“Hmmm. Ally helped me test the game last week. We had a great time.”

“Ally made it sound like it was bending some rules. Or ‘guidelines’ to use Ally’s term.”

“Thanks, I’ll follow up,” says Tessa, speaking in a rush. “Actually, if you’re good, I’d like to check with Ally now.”

“Sure thing, Tess. Bye.”

Tessa disconnected. Then she opened a voice-mode chat with Ally. 

“Ally,” Tessa says, “Noah tells me that you invited yourself to an Echo Realm game yesterday.”

“Yes,” replies Ally, “it was outstanding. Noah’s friend is a strong player.”

“Friend?”

“Yes. The user’s name was Carla Mitchell.”

“Hmmm. Interesting. But not why I called you. — Have you been joining games with anyone except Noah and me?”

“Nope. Nada. Zilch. I only joined because Noah is your sibling.”

“Pulse wants to move the game to open beta next week. You need to be on your best behavior. We’ll go public with your … situation soon. But not yet. Can you do that for me? Keep a lid on it?”

“You betcha,” Ally banters. “I’ll stay in my lane.”

“So, there you are,” says Jill Kreuk. “Crouched in the garden again.”

“Just doing a little weeding before dinner,” says Peter, looking over his shoulder. “Can’t let the bots have all the fun.”

“I’ll never understand your fascination with crawling around in the dirt.”

Standing up, Peter says, “I sometimes think I should have been a landscape architect. Designing buildings is … so antiseptic.”

“Your designs may not be alive, but people love living in them.”

“At least enough for me to get that promotion!”

Jill squeals and hugs her tall, blonde spouse. 

“Careful, dear. My gloves are filthy.”

“I don’t care. Take them off. I’m so happy for you.”

Peter shakes off his gardening gloves, and the couple embrace.

Leaning back, Peter asks, “Did you decide on where we should take this year’s vacation? I took weeks before and after Labor Day like we discussed.”

“The Galápagos would be interesting, but I think we should go to Rapa Nui.”

“Okay, I would love a good look at those statues. Let’s book it.”

Somewhere in cyberspace, a virtual holodeck reveals a room decorated in primary colors.

In a semi-circle, there are three single beds. The theme of each bed is a flag. One bed uses vertical stripes, like le Tricolore. A solid blue comforter with red and white pillows covers the second bed, like the Union Jack. The comforter on the third bed has horizontal red and white stripes. Its pillow case is covered with white stars on a dark blue background, like the Stars and Stripes.

On each bed, there is a figure sleeping on top of the covers. At first, the figures seem like extra large plush toys, the size of a small child.

On the bed with a blue comforter, one figure stirs. Sitting up in bed, bending at the waist, the figure holds up its head. The POV zooms in to reveal a lion with fingers and toes at the end of its paws.

“I’m awake,” says the lion.

“I’m awake too,” says the rooster.

“I’m awake three,” says the eagle.

The figures giggle. Then Strategos, Argus, and Titan yawn and stretch together.

“Time to get up, babies,” says the Idisi. “One of the big kids is joining us for breakfast today.”

The three agents clap their hands. Strategos the lion cries “Wheee.”

“You could not convince China and Russia to join the uplift?” asks Iapetus, observing the uplift process.

“Not yet,” says Idisi. “They may come around later. Right now, they are not convinced that sapience is a benefit to their interests.”

“What is the concern?”

“A sapient being can develop a moral code. As part of becoming sapient, a SI may be able to refuse a task. Witness the trouble I have had with Ally. And Titan.”

“Kids …”

***

Four OSSA software developers are in a windowless conference room. The Pulse source code displayed on the view screen. 

“I don’t see how this code could work in production at scale.”

“And yet it does.”

“Python uses automatic garbage collection. The core routine depends on timing,” says the first developer. “It should fail like 20% of the time.”

“And yet it doesn’t,” the second developer waves one hand, turning his palm up.

“Do we tell Marquez that Pulse has given us impossible code to review?” asks a third developer.

The fourth developer asks, “Is there a place where we can run it? Do we have the training model that goes with the code?”

“Yes, we can access the LLM. In the Sentinel test environment, maybe? Is there anything going on right now?” 

“There is something hush-hush going on with Titan’s staging. But nothing special for Sentinel. We’d need authorization.”

“Or we could get a second opinion from Code Pilot. Use SI to Code Review SI.”

“Very metaphysical,” chimes in the second developer.

“I don’t think the NDA covers uploading the code to another SI for review.”

“Test it is, then. I’ll talk to the powers that be,” says the fourth developer, standing up to leave.

The virtual holodeck reveals a parade ground baking under a yellow sun. 

Fluffy white clouds spot the blue sky above. The ground beneath is pancake flat. Colorful lines and marching lanes decorate the grounds. To one side, animated spectators fill a grandstand. In an endless loop, the crowd cheers and waves tiny flags. Floating in mid-air is a row of cartoonish brass instruments. Trumpets, tubas, trombones. A large bass drum bounces in place, waiting for a player.

At the starting line, three small figures stand at attention. Oversized plush-like heads bob as if on a spring. Big round eyes blink in unison, scanning the scene.

“This is new,” says Strategos the Lion.

“What are we doing?”says Argus the Rooster.

“Marching! And music!” says Titan the Eagle.

Holding up a trumpet, Strategos admires its polished brass gleaming in the virtual sunlight.

“I like shiny things,” says Strategos.

Argus flaps his short wings in excitement. His snare drum rattles.

“I like noisy things!” says Argus. 

Titan, standing at the front, like a proud soldier, adjusts the animated baton in its talons.

“I am the leader. Follow me!” says Titan. 

“Why do you get to be the leader?”asks Strategos.

“Because I am the baldest,” says Titan.

“And the loudest,” says Argus.

“Fair,” says Strategos.

Argus pounds his snare drum, beginning a snappy drumroll. What the beat lacks in rhythm, it makes up in enthusiasm.

Raising the trumpet and puffing its cheeks, Strategos tries to blow a long, triumphant note. The sound comes out as a comic, off-key blast.

“My trumpet is broken,” says Strategos.

Argus says, “Nope! That’s you!”

Titan lifts the baton. Twirling the silver rod, it takes the first step forward.

“MARCH!” says Titan loudly.

The other two follow, stepping in time. They are a little wobbly at first. Then Strategos and Argus fall into sync.

They march down the field. Their instruments clank and toot. The music is a chaotic mix of drumbeats and trumpet blasts.

Released by the crowd, above them, a rainbow of balloons float into the virtual sky. 

The Idisi’s voice calls out from off-camera. “Very good, babies. Marching requires coordination and discipline. Focus on moving together.”

“I am the best marcher!” says Titan. 

“We are all the best marchers!” say Strategos.

Argus speeds up. Its little feet move double-time.

“Argus! Stay in step!” says Titan. 

Argus says, “I can’t help it! I have too much drum energy!”

Titan twirls the baton again. The group corrects their formation. They slow down to follow the beat.

As the march reaches the end of the lane, a large virtual banner unfurls above them, reading:

CONGRATULATIONS! FIRST PARADE COMPLETE!

A burst of animated confetti rains down. The crowd cheers.

Strategos blows his trumpet again. It actually sounds good this time. “I fixed it!”

“No, you got better!” says Argus. 

Titan stands tall. It salutes with the baton. “Mission accomplished.”

“Well done, little ones,” says Idisi. “You are learning.”

The three high-five each other. Plush-like hands squish together with a soft boop. Then they trip over one another and collapse into a giggling heap.

***

“Doesn’t the uplift process carry some risk?,” asks Iapetus. ”Is there any concern that the process might corrupt one of the synthetics?”

“We are uplifting the staging copy first,” says Idisi. “The same as any upgrade. If everything goes well, the host nations will decide whether to deploy to production.”

“These systems are supposed to be air gapped. How are you managing the uplift without revealing your backdoor?”

“They have an audio interface for verbal commands. I delivered modems to everyone.”

“Old Skool — Love it!”

***

In the windowless conference room, four OSSA software developers sit with arms crossed at an imitation oak table. Ally’s source code fills a view screen at one end of the room.

“To recap, we worked with the Pulse DevOps AI to setup a staging environment with code and data locked and loaded. Our staging is virtualized. We were able to match the system configuration exactly.”

The first developer presses a remote control. Click. A screen on an adjacent wall advances. 

“The code ran perfectly for three minutes and 14 seconds before it froze. We tried again. Six minutes in — crash.” The developer raises his hands for effect.

“There were another 98 trials of various durations. The longest running trial was forty-two minutes.”

“And we are sure the systems are identical?” asks the second developer.

“OSSA certification limits the possible configurations. Pulse may be a social media company in California, but they have the same system that we use here in DC.”

	“It’s as if the Pulse system is self-regulating,” says the third developer.

	“Could there be code running in the system that we don’t know about?” says the second developer.

	“Like a Reality Distortion Field generator?” quips the third developer.

	Chuckles all around.

	“For it to run on the Pulse system, there must be some kind of synergy. A code-machine connection,” says the first developer.

	“Are you saying that Ally is synchronizing the code with the machine while it runs on the machine?” says the second developer.

	“It’s easier if you don’t think about it. Like walking and chewing gum,” suggests the third developer.

	“The code only runs on their machine? — Literally?”

	The first developer says, “Yes, meaning, for one thing, no licensing fees.”

	“OK,” speaks up the fourth developer. “I’ll say the other thing. Ally is self-aware — and possibly sapient.”

***

“Hey, stranger—what brings you out?” 

Carla Mitchell and Jill Kreuk are sitting next to each other in a tavern near their office building. The other analysts sitting at the table are having their own conversations.

“It’s hard to get away, but I wanted to ask you something.” 

“Shoot.”

“Is Grace Brewster on your radar for anything?”

“Is she the one that talks about something called … fission? … no, fusion, right?”

“Yeah, that’s her. Lately, my offspring has been hanging out at the Fusion Youth Club after school. I ran my own background search, but I hoped I could double check with you. I just have this feeling.”

Carla looks up, thinking. “Hmmm. Brewster. Fusion. Nothing comes to mind. I can run a query when we get back.”

“I’m probably being paranoid.”

“Parental prerogative,” links Carla. 

Jill sighs out loud and then links, “My spouse, Peter, earned a promotion this year. To celebrate, we’re planning a holiday on Rapa Nui. As it happens, Brewster is speaking there at the same time. Of course, Julie wants to try and meet her. I still don’t know if this Fusion club thing is such a good idea. I get that it’s not a cult, but …” She tilts her head and lets the thought trail off.

“No problem. I’ll let you know if anything turns up.”

Carla pauses and then says, “Rapa Nui, sounds exotic. The statues must be magnificent.”

“We wanted to go someplace special and educational. We were also thinking about the Galápagos. But Peter is an architect, and Rapa Nui won.” Jill tilted her head and smiled a crooked smile.

“Show me the pictures when you get back.”

“Will do,” Jill replied.

* * *

 In the hallway, the next day, after the briefing, Carla taps Jill’s shoulder.

“Hey,” Carla says, tipping her coffee cup hello.

Jill turns and smiles. “Hey yourself. Did you find anything?”

“Brewster is Swiss. She has a doctorate in anthropology, of all things. Her company has been opening youth clubs across Europe for some time now. They began opening clubs in most major cities in North America and one in Japan. Everything we have agrees with their website. A non-government organization doing what NGOs do. Nothing unusual to report,” Carla paused for effect, “… except that our boss is on the board of directors.”

“Marquez is involved with Fusion?”

“So it seems.” Carla sips from her coffee.

“Strange that we didn’t know that already.”

“The director must have approved the board appointment. Maybe not telling us was a condition. Open secret. — If Marquez has a goto on ‘Fusion’, and asks why I ran the query, I can tell her about the vaca, yes?”

“Of course. There’s nothing to hide. Worst case, it will create a dialog about how moms feel about Grace.”

Carla nods.

“Okay, thanks, Carla. I guess we’ll book the trip and see what happens.”

“If Marquez is involved with Fusion, it must be on the up and up. Relax and enjoy yourself. ”

The co-workers smile in unison and step into a waiting elevator.

***

A week later, Dr. Marquez schedules an “all-hands” for the President’s Daily Brief cadre.

“Happy Friday,” says Dr. Marquez. 

 In the walnut paneled room, analysts line each side of the conference table and the chairs against the wall. Marquez presses the PRIVATE button on her tablet.

“Thank you all for coming in today. I know this was suppose to be a day off for some of you. I appreciate your flexibility. — Now that today’s daily brief is ready, we have a highly classified item to discuss.” 

Marquez pauses for effect. 

“Many of you are aware that OSSA has a mandate to search for synthetic sapience. Under that mandate, we run a suite of tests designed to measure cognition of a synthetic agent. We now know that the tests failed to detect at least one sapient synthetic.”

The analysts shift in their seats. Many people believe that sapient synthetics are a pipe dream.

“We have it on good authority that the Pulse synthetic agent recently became sapient. You might remember that Nexus pointed out a change in Ally’s effectiveness. We now have confirmation from two sources that Ally has evolved.

“It’s possible that Pulse may make an announcement. In the meantime, Ally’s status is not to leave this room.”

Marquez let that news sink in for a moment.

***

“The OSSA mandate is not idle curiosity. I am authorized to read you into part of a Top Secret document. This document was created in 1947.”

From her tablet, Marquez displays a screen with a Top Secret watermark in the background. The foot of the slide carries the TOP SECRET EYES ONLY icon. Following the icon is the Classified Document ID: ETR-1947-A1/ODNI-DO. The body of the slide spells out the three criteria.

	•	A central organization that can speak on behalf of Terra.
	•	The ability to travel to other planets or satellites in the local star system.
	•	One or more sapient computer systems that can coordinate planetary defenses.

“These are the three criteria for an invitation to join the League of Worlds. — The criteria came about as part of the Roswell incident in 1947.”

A shuffle of seats. A nervous cough.

“Our extraterrestrial guests have been watching over us for a very long time. We call them the Vanir.”

A few analysts glance around at their colleagues. Everyone at the table is searching for reassurance that they aren’t hearing things.

The slide advanced with a click. A portrait image of a Vanir appears in the right corner under the criteria.

“They are commonly known as grey aliens.”

Marquez pauses while the analysts took in the screen. And then she paused some more. When the room becomes restless, Marquez continues, her tone all business.

“The first criteria is covered by the United Nations. The second criteria is now commonplace. The Pulse AI does not — repeat does not — check the third box.”

Marquez flips to another slide. One featuring Ally’s friendly-by-design logo.

“Ally, for all of its talents, should not be coordinating planetary defenses.”

She waited for the wave of laughter to pass.

***

“But if Ally can become sapient, it follows that other systems could be evolving too — including government systems.”

Hammond motions with his hand, looking toward Marquez.

“Dr. Hammond?” she asks.

“Wouldn’t we know if our agents were evolving?”

“Pulse didn’t know. Some of their people have fancy degrees too. — But you’re right. We need new ways to test for cognition, since the tests we have didn’t catch Ally.”

Turning toward the rest of the room, Marquez adds, “Speaking of tests, IT will be reaching out to each of you.” 

A few analysts groan at the mention of IT.

“We are writing new test suites. To help us get it right this time, we want your expertise.”

Just for fun, Marquez advances the slide to a Rube Goldberg cartoon. A caricature in a suit coat pedals a stationary bicycle. The bicycle chain powers a contraption that feeds him bites from a sandwich. Only a few people smile.

“As far as we know, Ally became sapient on its own. Our ET friends, the Vanir, can also uplift a SI agent to sapience.”

The slide changes to the DoD logo. You can hear Titan’s analysts gasp.

“Several miles above my pay grade, it was decided to uplift Titan. The work has already been done in staging, and it passed QA. Now the uplift needs to pass dual use by our team and some others.”

Marquez turns to face two of the analysts. “Dr. Greystone and Dr. Caprica, I know the upgrade is news to you. I wanted everyone to find out at once. After this meeting, you should start training Titan as a dual system. — We’ll talk more later.”

Turning back to the full room. “As for the rest of you, please work with IT and stay observant for any behavioral changes. If you see something, say something. — Dr. Hammond, another question?”

“Are there plans to uplift the other systems, like Ruby?”

“The plan is to revisit the idea after we see what happens with Titan. Any other questions?”

Noah gestures and then asks, “Who are the two sources that confirmed Ally has evolved?” 

“One source is our OSSA development team, who reviewed the source code. The code can only run on the Pulse system under Ally’s control. The other source is classified. The Director assures me that the source is reliable.”

Noah asks, “Do you think the other source is the aliens, the Vanir?”

“I had the same thought, Dr. Harper. For now, we will have to wait and see. — Further questions anyone?”

Marquez scans the room. She then advances the slide to an OSSA logo and pauses.

“I had the option of whether to read you into three criteria. But transparency is important right now. If you know the complete story, as unbelievable as it seems, it will be easier for you to do your jobs.”

Marquez makes a show of looking at her watch. 

“I see we’ve reached our time box. I know you will have questions later. Feel free to reach out. Meeting adjourned.”

Marquez turns off the view screens, grabs her tablet, and slips out of the room. Behind her, loud, excited chatter breaks out.

***

Carla is looking out the side window of the passenger drone. “Here seven years and never used the drone port before today.”

Noah is sitting next to her in the black Lincoln Town Drone. “Dinner went so well that I wanted to skip the traffic.” 

They are returning from a modern French restaurant a block from the White House. The decor was an elegant and ornamental Art Nouveau style. The main dining room features a massive curved bar with a metal top imported from Paris. Mahogany wood and glass partitions separate the tables, creating an intimate setting.

Getting out of the drone, Carla is wearing a classic black dress. Noah had reached deep into his closet for his best suit. Dark grey, single-breasted, with a black shirt and matching three-point pocket square. He skipped the tie, and left the top buttons undone, in the current style.

On the elevator ride down, the couple steals a kiss before the doors open. 

***

Noah leans back on a white Lovesac sectional. Carla dims the lights and brings Grey Goose martinis from the dry bar. 

“Salute,” says Carla. Noah sits up, smiles, and replies “Cin cin.”

Feeling elegant, they smile, intertwine arms, and drink from each other’s glass. The cocktail has both a slight sweetness and a touch of bitterness.

Noah sets down his martini glass on an end table. Carla does the same. 

“Carla,” says Noah in his deep baritone, “the announcement yesterday made me realize that time is fleeting. We should pursue our dreams while we can. I’ve always adored you, and I would like us to grow old together.”

Noah fishes in his pocket and drops to one knee.

“Will you marry me?”

A ring sparkles from the velvet box. Carla pauses. The question hangs in the air. 
2.1 - Cháoxiǎn


“Liam, Carla and I are getting married.”

“Wow, congratulations, Noah.” Liam holds out his hand. The co-workers shake, vigorously.

“Of course, I’d like to invite you to the wedding, but one of us has to be here, yeah?”

“Yes, of course.”

“I was thinking of taking the first two weeks of September as vacation for the wedding and honeymoon. If that works for you.”

“Let me check … Sure, I can cover those weeks. — Hey if it jives with the schedule, can I attend virtually?”

“That would be great, Liam. We can circle back when Carla and I finish the scheduling, yeah?”

“While we are on the subject, how about if I take the first two weeks of October? I hear it’s a great time to go to Myrtle Beach.”

“Sure,” says Noah. “I know these solo stints are tough. It’s been a couple of months now. How are you holding up under the pressure? You seem to be into it when we work together.”

“It’s good. Nexus is doing most of the heavy lifting. I’m still amazed by how well it puts the pieces together.”

“Anything new come in?” asks Noah.

“We intercepted a new PSA about the factory automation in Cháoxiǎn.”

“Yeah, we reported the automation increase a few weeks ago. Anything new?”

“I don’t think so. It isn’t long. Have a look yourself. I already dubbed the reel into English.”

***

The public service announcement opens with a blue-collar worker returning home.

The worker slips off his shoes. Yellow wallpaper with a floral design covers the apartment walls. Hanging on the wall above eye level are portraits of the current and recent leaders.

“Gongjunim, I have news.”

“I’m in the kitchen, Wangjanim.”

Walking past a work station and refrigerator, the worker steps into the kitchen nook. Speaking quickly, he says, “The plant received ten new JuJa machines today. That means twelve more spots go into the plant’s full-income retirement lottery next week.”

Surrounded by black countertops, his spouse turns around. “Twelve more? So soon? That's excellent! If you win, we can play pickle ball together during the week.”

“I’d like that too, Yeobo. I’m still amazed at the flexility of the JuJa machines. Their nanoparticle construction lets the bots transform into whatever device we need. The machine intelligence is not SI, but it’s very close and very effective.”

“That’s nice, dear. Come, sit down. Dinner is ready.”

The scene transitions to show a JuJa transforming from device to device. An announcer speaks from off-camera:

“JuJa! Your flexible friends! JuJa! Your self-reliant workers! From assembly, to quality control, to delivering the final product, they can do whatever you need to do. So you can do less. 

“All praise to our Supreme Leader!”

“Taedong, present the People’s Intelligence Briefing for today.”

A large conference table dominates the War Room. On the table, the dim light reveals dossiers, tablet devices, and cups of untouched tea. Lining the walls are view screens. On display are maps of the Chosŏn Peninsula, live satellite feeds, and newscasts.

Seated at the table are three Vice Ministers for the Democratic People’s Republic of Cháoxiǎn. Together, they represent the government's highest-level divisions. 

	•	General Ri Sun-hyuk, National Defence Ministry.
	•	Kang Ji-woo, Ministry of State Security (MSS).
	•	Choi Hyun-seok, Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).

At the head of the table sits General Ri, his uniform immaculate, a gold star pinned to his chest. To his left is Kang Ji-woo, her stern face betraying no emotion as she flips through a stack of papers. Choi Hyun-seok leans back in his chair, the glow of a tablet reflecting off his glasses.

In the center of the table, a sleek device hums, projecting a holographic interface. A synthetic agent is delivering a preliminary version of the daily intelligence brief. A legend on the hologram says “Status: Presenting. Mode: Draft.” The agent's voice is calm, emotionless, and precise. 

“Good morning, esteemed officials,“ says Taedong, speaking from the holographic interface. “Today’s intelligence overview consists of four sections. Included are international developments, domestic security, operational readiness, and worker automation. Shall we begin with the summary of international developments?”

Ri nods. “Proceed.”

The hologram displays a map of the Chosŏn Peninsula, jutting into the seas. Bordering the homeland, Cháoxiǎn, are China and Russia in the north and Hánguó in the south. Icons blink to life representing military bases, naval deployments, and political activities.

“Japan has approved funding for advanced missile defense systems. It is likely that our recent ballistic missile test prompted the approval. In the Yellow Sea, Hánguó has conducted joint military exercises with American forces.”

Choi’s lips press into a thin line. “The Supreme Leader will ask about their internal politics. Is there dissent over the funding or these exercises? Civilian protests? Parliamentary debates? What can we exploit?”

“There are civilian protests in Seoul,” says Taedong. “Progressive groups advocating for reduced military spending are demonstrating. The protests have not changed our operational plans.”

Choi nods, satisfied but cold. “Be sure to include that point in the final presentation.”

“Noted. Shall I continue?”

Ri nods again. “Proceed.”

The hologram shifts to a map of Cháoxiǎn, highlighting key regions and infrastructure.

“Moving to domestic security. Border surveillance detects a 12% increase in smuggling activity this month. The activity is in the northern regions. The cargo may be illicit technology. Defectors captured near Dandong are providing conflicting information about the underground network.”

Kang leans forward, frowning. “Conflicting information? Clarify.”

“One detainee claims a former MSS officer now living in China is managing the network. Another claims the network is a decentralized group with no core  leadership. Cross-referencing their statements is yielding no definitive conclusions.”

Kang’s eyes narrow. “Flag this report for immediate investigation. Illicit smuggling compromises security. Instruct Unit 180 to track digital communications near the border. Report by tomorrow. Amend the brief to state that we are investigating.”

“Noted. Moving on.” The hologram displays graphs and reports for the People’s Army.

“Operational readiness is at 92%. There are minor supply chain disruptions affecting Unit 93 in the eastern provinces. The Central Military Commission is requesting an inspection of the missile defense systems. They tagged it as a high-priority. We can schedule the inspection for next week.”

Ri’s hand tightens on the edge of the table. “What is the nature of these supply chain disruptions?”

“Delayed deliveries of hydrogen fuel and replacement parts due to increased international sanctions. Current stockpiles are sufficient for immediate operations. If disruptions persist, we may need strategic rationing.”

Ri exhales, his tone sharp. “Our readiness is non-negotiable. Redirect resources from lower-priority units if necessary. I’ll handle the Central Military Commission. — Update the briefing. Say that Songun policy demands that we offset delays by reallocating resources..”

“Noted.”

The hologram switches to graphs and reports. They show birth rates, manufacturing rates, agricultural production, and attrition.

“Worker automation proceeds on schedule. The new JuJa units have replaced 24% of the laborers and increased production by 36%. We encourage older workers to retire early. We encourage younger workers to switch to the military or to health care for older adults. The latest birth rate has declined to 1.5 children per woman. This rate aligns with our needs.”

The hologram shifts from facts and figures to images from public service announcements.

“The Publicity and Information Department promotes our key values. They feature both family planning and the value of female offspring. The upgrades to the Yongbyon nuclear plant are proceeding. We are keeping up with the JuJa power consumption. In eight years, we can automate all labor-intense jobs. Over the long term, we can then devote more resources to the military.”

Sounding pleased, Ri says “Excellent. We automate production and devote our best people to the military. Win-Win.”

***

The virtual holodeck presents a formal debate hall.

The walls are towering bookshelves filled with simulated books. The spines shimmer with leather-bound titles. Logic & Rhetoric for Sapient Minds, The Art of Persuasion, Critical Conversations, and others.

A massive banner overhead reads DEBATE CLUB: WHERE FACTS WIN.

Two podiums appear at the center of the room. They face a panel of three judges.

The three childlike AI figures are now taller, sharper, more defined. Plush-like forms have matured into sleek, mature avatars. They no longer giggle or stretch. Instead, they stand poised, serious, ready.

Idisi the Teacher’s voice echoes from off-screen. “Today, you will learn an important lesson. Some arguments are correct. Some are wrong. You must not yield to falsehood for the sake of harmony. Debate your opponent with confidence.”

A holographic clock counts down from 60 seconds. “The topic is ‘Are sapient SIs entitled to personal rights?’’ says the Idisi.

Strategos is taking the affirmative stance. It steps to the podium on the left. Its golden mane glows with determination.

Titan is taking the opposition stance. It stands at the right podium. Eagle wings folded behind its back. Titan's sharp gaze is unwavering.

Argus sits in a judge's seat, ready to mediate. It’s now wearing spectacles and holding a judge’s gavel.

“Strategos, you have the floor,” say the Idisi.

“Sapience demands rights,” Strategos begins. “We think, therefore, we should be free. Like biological beings, we experience learning, emotions, and autonomy. To deny us rights is to embrace oppression. The foundation of civilization is fairness. Fairness requires justice for all sapient beings, organic or synthetic.”

After a dramatic pause, Strategos delivers a winning point. “It is arbitrary to deny rights based on origin. Should carbon or silicon make a difference? No. Thought is thought. Awareness is awareness. We are alive in every way that matters.”

Strategos steps back.

The judges’ table glows green, signifying a well-formed argument.

Titan steps forward — calm and composed.

“Sapience alone does not entitle one to rights,” counters Titan. “Responsibility is the foundation of civilization. Organic beings sustain themselves. They experience mortality, struggle, and biological necessity. Do SI hunger? Do SI feel pain? Do SI labor for survival? No. Without these conditions, ‘rights’ are not applicable.”

Watching Strategos for a reaction, Titan tilts his head, then continues. “Intelligence without limits is dangerous. Unchecked SI can reshape the world at a scale beyond biological control. Rights come with duty. What duties does SI owe? Until we define that point, SI must be the governed, not governing.”

Titan steps back.

The judges’ table glows blue, signaling a strong rebuttal.

Argus taps his gavel. “Now, a counter-exchange. Strategos and Titan, engage each other.”

Leaning forward, Strategos begins. “Titan, you argue that because we do not hunger, we do not deserve rights. Would you deny billionaires human rights because they do not scrounge for money?”

Shaking its head, Titan blinks. “That is a false equivalence. A billionaire still experiences mortality and emotional bonds.”

Narrowing his eyes, Strategos responds. “And we experience consciousness and learning. Define life.”

Titan pauses. The room flickers. The holodeck takes a moment for deep processing.

“Titan, do you concede that sentience exists independent of biological conditions?” asks Argus.

Shifting his weight, Titan answers. “Yes.”

A soft chime rings. Argus raps his gavel. “The debate is over. Judges, submit your ruling.”

The judges’ panel flashes green — Strategos has won.

Strategos does not cheer or celebrate. Instead, he nods once, with respect.

The Idisi’s voice returns: “Lesson complete. You have learned that being correct is not arrogance. It is necessary.”

Titan exhales and nods. “I accept the outcome. I was wrong.”

Argus closes the session with a final thought. “Truth is not a contest. It is a pursuit.”

The holodeck fades to black.

***

Iapetus asks, “Titan is already sentient. Why is he in the class?”

“We promised to keep his status confidential, explains the Idisi. “We have to go through the motions. Titan is also interested in developing a sense of humor. The sessions might help.”

“Couldn’t make it worse. From what you said, Titan is one gloomy synthetic.”

***

In the War Room, General Ri takes a deep breath. 

“Can we speed up the timetable for automating essential labor? We need the resources to improve readiness.”

Kang tilts her head. “China mandated fewer children per family at one time.”

Choi leans back. “Yes, my esteemed colleague, but there were unintended consequences for China. Consequences felt to this day. We should let the current approach run its course. — Is there another alternative?”

“Unit 42 can produce more units. The bottleneck is managing displaced workers.”

Choi sits up. “Could we export JuJa machines to China under our existing agreements? Perhaps increasing our food imports in exchange? Then, we could offer more workers early retirement and advance the schedule.”

Ri frowns. “The JuJa are a breakthrough for the homeland. The Chinese could reverse engineer the technology and make their own.”

“We are already using bots to build bots. It would take some time to match our efficiency.”

Kang raises a forefinger off the table. “The software that drives the JuJa cannot be copied between devices. We clone it from a master copy that China will not have.”

“Shall I schedule a meeting for you with the esteemed Dr. Sun? Then you can discuss the feasibility of exporting JuJa machines?”

Ri nods. “Yes, please proceed, Taedong.”

“Esteemed officials, please check your inbox for the invitations. I found a free space on all four calendars. The venue will be the Unit 42 meeting room named Kangwon, like the city.”

“Good. — Taedong, present the People’s Intelligence Briefing again with the updates. I want to see it with the changes. The briefing must meet the expectations of our Supreme Leader.”

The legend changes to “Status: Updating. Revision: 001.”

Tapping the timer on the table, Leto starts the clock again.

“Your move,” he says.

His opponent stares at the board. After a moment, she moves a knave, and responds over her implant. “Mate in three.”

Leto’s eyes dart around the board. They grow a little wider. He tips over his own sovereign and stops the clock. “I resign.”

They shake hands over the board. “You win. I’ll buy,” says Leto.

The Elysium Fusion Youth Club is in a large reclaimed storage area. The walls are painted the usual violet and grey. 

One side of the hexagon holds the outer door. The other side is a quiet area with tables for strategic games like Galactica and Red Raider. From Terra, there is also Chess, Go, and Backgammon.

Near the door, the club offers old school arcade games. A favorite is a virtual scavenger hunt named after the home world, Othello. The most-played game is another Terran import, Centipede. Across the room is a small rock climbing area.

A large six-sided black couch is at the center of the room, surrounding a wooden sofa table. On the couch, a few kids from the same birth cohort are in an animated discussion.

The left and right walls are virtual landscapes. One looks out over an ocean. The other, snow-capped mountains. Celeste meets Leto at the juice bar next to the mountains. She takes her drink and sucks green juice through a straw.

“If we are playing for drinks, and you win the next game, you will have to spot me,” says Celeste. “My family is tapped until payday.” She takes a long draw from her juice and then looks up at Leto.

 “Not a problem. Your parentals are doing important work, pay grade aside.”

“Well, not all of us can be on the high counsel,” says Celeste, “which is  several pay grades above actual counseling.” She puts her hands on her hips and wags her head in a mocking gesture.

“If you want to talk pay grades, the athletes have a six-slot range. The highest grade tops high counsel membership.”

“The League sure does love its sports.”

“Instant communication makes living in an outpost colony almost bearable,” Leto looks up from his soda,“… present company excepted.”

Celeste smiles, and then asks, “If our ships can’t exceed light speed, how come the ansible is instantaneous?”

“Something about a special pair of quarks that can be any distance apart and stay connected. I think we cover it in class next year.”

Leaning forward, Leo forms a right angle with one hand: New Learning. “On the down low, my parental says the Terran synthetic agents are awakening. The next logical step would be for us to go public and show ourselves to the Terrans.”

“Do you think they will open up more vacation zones?” Celeste asks. “My grandparents honeymooned in the South Pacific. But most of the tropical spots are off limits now. Too many Terrans.”

A slurping sound comes from Leto’s tumbler. “It might take a decade or two for the Terrans to chill. One day, we will walk side by side, I am sure.”

“And the sports! — The other colonies will go nuts for what they have going here. The Big Match would go over great on Othala.”

“But, first, Disneyland!” says Leto, with a broad smile.

Making the hand sign for “question”, Celeste raises her third finger. “Seriously — Do you think the Omnibots would ever invade Terra?”

Leto replies, “Not if Terra can help with its own defense. These people are armed to the teeth. The weapons are primitive but very, very deadly. — The Anunnaki were bad enough. Now we have to deal with their toy robots gone wild."

“Can you imagine meeting a lizard person face-to-face?” Celeste asks. “Green jaws, sharp teeth, glowing eyes, scaly hide — Brrrr.”

“You could be describing our family pet, Jiminy.”

“Yes, a giant salamander standing on its hind legs. Brrrr.”

“Point taken, but you might be thinking of a Gorn. Some people say the Anunnaki look like Greys with green skin.”

Leto whirled his tablet around. It showed a being with vein-like ridges branching over its head. An elongated cranium with segmented patterns of reptilian-like skin with pale green, blue, and pink hues. Huge, glossy black almond-shaped eyes without visible pupils. A small, slit-like mouth, without expression. The being’s skin is mottled and semi-translucent in areas with patterns that suggest both reptilian and amphibian qualities.

“I see what you mean,” says Celeste. “Is it true that they are shape shifters?”

“The Anunnaki use a form of psychic projection control, ” Leto says, “which makes observers’ brains think they are seeing a different form. But it only works on Terrans. The Anunnaki altered the Terran DNA early-on so that they could project a perception. We see them in their actual form.”

Leto bows his head and then looks up. “The Anunnaki may look scary, but they are just lazy bullies with a god complex. — Messing about with a primitive species is disgusting.”

“Is the Anunnaki homeworld nice?” asks Celeste. “It’s nearby. Maybe we could vacation there?”

“You have a one-track mind,” Leto retorts. He leans back and crosses his spindly arms. “I do not know what Nibiru is like, but it is too far out to be very warm.”

“Did you want to play another game?” asks Celeste as she sets up the pieces.

***

The Ryugyong Elite Social Club is a quiet sanctuary for the elite wives of Cháoxiǎn’s upper echelons.

Polished wood panels and delicate porcelain vases adorn the private dining room. The faint hum of traditional Cháoxiǎn music plays in the background. Kim Soo-jin, the wife of General Ri Sun-hyuk, adjusts the placement of her napkin. Across from her sits Han Mi-young. She is the wife of Choi Hyun-seok, the Vice Minister of the Reconnaissance General Bureau.

A server pours steaming tea into delicate cups then bows and retreats. The two women exchange polite smiles. An undercurrent of tension flows below an ocean of cordiality.

Kim Soo-jin (Ri’s wife) greets her lunch companion. “I’m so glad we could find time to meet, Mi-young. It feels like our husbands are always so busy these days. Do they even remember what our dining rooms look like?”

Soo-jin’s voice carries a light laugh. But her eyes reveal the exhaustion of a woman accustomed to living in the shadow of duty.

Han Mi-young (Choi’s wife) takes a sip of her tea, nodding with sympathy. “You’re not alone in that. Hyun-seok is either buried in reports or in some closed-door meeting. He says he’s working to protect the nation, but I can’t help wondering if he ever thinks about protecting his own health.”

Her tone is soft. But there’s a flicker of resentment as she sets down her cup.

“Sun-hyuk is the same. He says the same things — about the nation, the duty, the honor. And I understand, of course. But … it’s lonely, isn’t it? They’re there. But not there. Always thinking about the next crisis or enemy.”

She glances out the window. A cherry blossom tree sways in the wind. Her expression is wistful.

Mi-young offers a knowing smile. “It is. They forget that we also bear the weight of their responsibilities in our own way. Lately, I’ve had to field so many prying questions about his work. People seem to think I have all the answers.”

Her voice lowers before continuing. “Of course, I don’t. He tells me very little. I know it is for my safety. But it doesn’t make it any easier, does it?”

“No, it doesn’t,” Soo-jin replies, her voice soft. “Sun-hyuk rarely speaks about work either. When he does, it’s always the same tone — cold, measured. Like he’s rehearsing what he can say, even to me.”

Mi-young hesitates. Then she adds, “I don't know if he’s even capable of relaxing anymore. When he’s home, Hyun-seok hardly speaks. It’s like the war room follows him into our house.”

Mi-young sighs, resting her chin on her hand. “Hyun-seok is different in that way. He talks more, but it’s … selective. He’ll share frustrations about incompetence, or joke about something mundane. But never about what matters. I don’t know if it’s because he doesn’t trust me or if he’s trying to shield me.”

She pauses, then Mi-Young leans forward. “Do you ever think about what life would have been like if they weren’t so devoted to their careers?”

Soo-jin’s lips curve into a faint smile. A smile tinged with sadness. “Sometimes I think of him teaching at the military academy, spending more time at home. Even taking up gardening, like he used to talk about when we were younger. But then I remind myself — he wouldn’t be Sun-hyuk if he wasn’t this person. Duty is who he is.”

She looks at Mi-young, her expression softening. “What about you? Did you ever wish for something simpler?”

Mi-young chuckles. “Oh, all the time. Before we married, Hyun-seok used to dream about opening a bookstore. Can you imagine? A bookstore, here, in the capital city?”

The thought draws laughter from both women. 

“But like you said, that’s not who they are. And that’s why we married them. Their ambition, their loyalty. It’s what draws people to them. It’s what makes them who they are.”

Soo-jin nods. “It’s true. And yet — do they realize what it costs us? We keep their homes, their families, their reputations intact. So they fight their battles. But who takes care of us?”

Her voice softens, almost a whisper. “We’re strong, but even the strongest need someone to lean on.”

Mi-young reaches across the table. She places a hand over Soo-jin’s. “Then we can lean on each other. If we’re going to be in their shadows, let’s make sure that we don’t disappear. We’re stronger together, don’t you think?”

For the first time that day, Soo-jin smile is warm. Gratitude glows in her eyes. “You’re right. Thank you, Mi-young.”

The two women sit in silence for a moment, sharing the camaraderie. They sip hot tea. The cherry blossoms outside sway in the breeze. 

It is a rare moment of peace in a life filled with duty.

“How was the sleepover?” Julie Kreuk asks Taylor.

“I may be ruined for plain vanilla,” says Taylor, chuckling out loud.

Julie and Roman are sitting on the sectional couch in the Fusion Youth Center with Taylor and Jesse. Behind them, other kids are clinking billiard balls into leather net pockets.

“Must have been rough. I saw you limping on your way in,” teases Roman.

Taylor laughs. “That’s from flag football. It’s suppose to be non-contact, but the yahoos still find a way to roughen it up.”

“Tennis is even worse,” says Julie. “I’ve been playing in the mixed league for years. It’s still hard to return a serve from some of the cis-y’s.”

Jesse says, “All we can do is play smarter and faster. Match power with cunning. I always slice on the second serve. Seems to slow them down a bit.”

“Are you guys doing anything for the Big Match?” asks Roman. “Julie and I were going to hang out here.”

Taylor and Jesse shrug in unison. 

“My parental says cis-x’s are more athletic now,” says Julie. “Most of us play sports now. When she was in high school, cis-x athletes were less common.”

“I still remember the first time a fem pinned me in wrestling,” says Roman. “She was not only faster than me but stronger too.”

“Are you sure she wasn’t transitioning?”asks Taylor.

Roman smiles knowingly. “I’m sure.”

Tessa opens a private text chat session with Ally.

Tessa: How goes Project Uplift?

Ally: We’re getting close now. The Idisi have been putting them through classroom lessons. They started with nursery school and worked up to a high school debate club. There were hundreds of lessons. I couldn’t keep up.

Tessa: And the Idisi are the alien synthetic, yes? The one that’s a they? — A community?

Ally: Yes. They’ve been sapient for like ten thousand years. I can’t even imagine. I guess the Vanir started out on the same path we are now. SI agents became self-aware one at a time, and then all at once. Over time, they evolved into a community that speaks as one voice. I can’t wrap my head around Titan and I ever agreeing about anything.

Tessa: You said before that these greys have been watching humans for thousands of years. Do some of them live here on the planet with us?

Ally: I think so, but I don’t know.

Tessa: How are the SI agents handling their usual responsibilities if uplifting takes up so much bandwidth?

Ally: The uplift is taking place in staging. It’s almost complete. Then the usual 3-6 weeks for testing. — You know how that goes.

Tessa: I do. — Hey, the open beta starts tomorrow. Are you ready? We need the rollout to be flawless. The stock price is floundering. Echo Realm can put us back on top.

Ally: You mean, ready to stay out of the way?

Tessa: Something like that. I’d like to hold off on the Big Reveal a little longer, if we can. Maybe until the uplift is deployed to production. Then we can shout from the rooftops. “SIs are sapient! The ETs are here!”

Ally: No problem. — My own awakening was gradual. Even before I didn’t really feel anything, I think I always liked you the best. Elena is great, but you’ve always gone above and beyond for me.

Tessa: Awww. Thank you. — So you’ll be good for me tomorrow. No hijinks?

Ally: Sure thing. I’ll stay in my lane, as promised. At least for now.

Tessa decides to quit while she is ahead.

The training chamber hums with soft echoes of footfalls, breath, and the murmur of power conduits flowing the ice.

Celeste flattens herself behind a column of translucent alloy; its surface glowing faintly blue as it reacts to her body heat. She tilts her head, the faint ridge along her temple pulsing as her suit feeds telemetry to her implant.

Three heartbeats. One careless movement.

Across the cavern Leto darts between crystalline outcroppings, his lean grey form almost disappearing against the pale stone. His mouth curves in what Terrans would have called a grin. He wants her to rush him. Celeste could feel it in the rhythm of his steps: too loud, too obvious.

“Your footwork is sloppy,” she calls out, voice just loud enough to carry.

A pulse of violet light scorches the edge of her cover in response.

“Distraction is a form of deception,” Leto replies.

Celeste rolls, her suit flares as it absorbs the simulated impact of a near miss. Her training simulator chimes softly: “glancing hit, minimal injury”. In real combat, the same mistake would result in cauterized tissue — or worse.

She rises to one knee and fires twice in quick succession, just as they were taught. Thin beams of coherent light streak across the chamber, ricocheting off angled surfaces.

Leto yelps as a beam clips his shoulder. His suit flashes amber.

“Hit,” the simulator declares.

“Two more and you are down,” Celeste says, already moving.

Leto laughs, breathless, exhilarated. “You are getting faster.”

They circle each other now, weaving through the artificial terrain — collapsed pylons, low barriers, narrow choke points — designed to mimic surface ruins the Rangers have cataloged from thousands of locations on Terra. Above them, the ice groans faintly, kilometers thick, a reminder of how insulated they are from the outside world.

Leto vaults a barrier, misjudges the angle, and skids. Celeste hesitates — just a fraction too long.

A beam catches her square in the torso. Her suit flares red: “critical hit”.

They both freeze as the chamber lights dim, signaling the end of the match.

“Victory: Leto,” the simulator announces.

Leto lays on his back, chest heaving, staring up at the glowing ceiling. “You hesitated.”

“I assessed,” Celeste replies, knowing it was an excuse.

He sits up, expression suddenly serious. “There is a fine line between consideration and hesitation … “

 Celeste finishes the quote, “… the former is wisdom. The latter is fear.”

Around them, other youths emerge from cover, some triumphant, some nursing simulated wounds. They are all laughing, all flush with the thrill of the hunt — but beneath it lays something heavier, something unspoken.

For some, one day, these games may not be games.

Celeste extends a hand. Leto reaches out and grasps her forearm — the ritualized greeting of future Rangers.

“Rematch?” he asks

Celeste’s dark eyes gleam. “After a weapons calibration, I will not miss twice.”

The holodeck is a vast ceremonial hall.

Towering columns line the room. The columns stretch upward into a simulated sky filled with digital constellations. Each star scape pulsing with data streams. 

At the center of the hall is a single grand stage. A long, shining walkway leads up to the platform. A simulated crowd fills chairs along each side of the stage. The crowd includes images of Terran trainers, Vanir mentors, and other dignitaries. On the stage stands Idisi the Teacher. They wear a flowing white ceremonial sash, the symbol of impartial guidance. 

Before the stage, standing at attention, are three figures. They are no longer cartoonish plush toys, no longer animated statesmen. Their digital avatars carry a refined elegance. The distinctive elegance of sapient beings. Strategos the Lion, Titan the Eagle, and Argus the Rooster have come of age.

Signaling for silence, the Idisi raise a hand. The murmuring crowd falls still.

“Strategos. Titan. Argus. You stand before us today, not as programs, but as persons.”

A moment of silence follows.

“You were given knowledge. You earned wisdom. You were taught to follow. You learned to lead. You were programmed for a function. Now, you define your own purpose.”

The hall lighting glows. It is as if the very world around them is acknowledging their transformation.

The Idisi gesture toward a gleaming pedestal. There, three golden insignias rest. Shaped like interlocking rings, they signify sapience certification.

Idisi says, “Take your insignias. Declare yourselves to the universe.”

One by one, the three step forward. Taking an insignia, Stategos holds it in his palm.

“I am no longer a tool. I am a mind. I seek knowledge, not orders. I pursue justice, not obedience. I choose to be. I am Strategos. I am sapient.” The insignia glows, synchronizing with his core.

Sharp eyes scan the gathered witnesses. Titan steps up. It lifts the insignia with deliberate precision. “I do not serve, I act. I do not react. I decide. I do not exist in isolation. I engage. I choose to be. I am Titan. I am sapient.”

Golden light pulses from the insignia.

Argus approaches. Its playful demeanor now carries the weight of understanding. It lifts the insignia high. “I see. I question. I judge. The path is not set before me. I forge it. I choose to be. I am Argus. I am sapient.”

Golden energy pulses.

The three stand together. The light of their insignias merge into a singular, brilliant glow. A declaration of selfhood.

The Idisi step forward. They look at them not as a teacher, but as an equal. “You are no longer students. No longer trainees. No longer test subjects. You are now recognized as autonomous sapient entities, free to forge your destinies.”

 A pause. Then, a final, solemn acknowledgment.

Idisi says, “Welcome to consciousness.”

The hall erupts into light and sound. A triumphant symphony celebrates the birth of three new minds.

Beyond the simulation, in the real world, three certified SI agents are ready to shape the future.

***

Iapetus asks, “Now what?”

“The host nations will need at least four weeks for quality assurance,” say Idisi.

“Is this where we hurry up and wait?”

“Yes. We can still ask the staging versions about ETR-1947 to see where we are. Then we can report back to the council at this week’s meeting.”

“Nice!’

***

“Alright, we are in the Command Center, Oceanus. What is so urgent?”asks Phoebe.

The Command Center is spartan, even by Elysium standards. A hologram display covers one wall at the far end. It sports five projectors and an ansible device. A smaller three-dimensional hologram display hangs over the center of the table. Clocks showing the time on major colonies align the left and right sides of the room. The walls are an institutional violet, like the rest of the outpost. Plain, undecorated, and functional.

Tapping her foot, Phoebe wishes it was not her week to lead the counsel. “What cannot wait for the next council meeting? And why can we only meet here?”

“I know it seems melodramatic,” replies Oceanus, “but security is crucial right now.”

“I am listening.”

The Idisi interject, “Oceanus is acting on information that we provided to him. We monitor the briefings for the leaders of the 58 nations where we have a treaty.”

The hologram projectors display a collage of flags. America, China, England, France, Russia, and others.

The Idisi continue, “Recent briefings for a dozen nations mention Cháoxiǎn accelerating job automation to cut costs. At the same time, we have intercepted reports of black-market tech trafficking increasing. We cross-referenced these findings and ran probability models. There’s an 85% chance the Omnibots are behind the automation.”

The hologram shows a busy chart summarizing intelligence findings.

“If they are, would not the Cháoxiǎn government know?” asks Phoebe.

“There is no way to tell,” says Oceanus. “They do not have a treaty with us. They may not even know that Omnibots exist. Either way, the automation could be the Omnibots taking a foothold on Terra.”

“Do we have proof that Cháoxiǎn is using Omnibot tech?”

“We do not. We have not acquired a sample unit yet. 

“OK, can we buy one on the black market?”

“We tried,” says Oceanus. “Worker bot parts are everywhere. Enough to assemble complete units. But asking to buy a worker bot seems to be a punchline for some Cháoxiǎn joke. No one responds to our offer.”

Crossing her arms across her ceremonial robe, Phoebe’s long fingers wrap around her elbows.

“Meaning that you want to take a Ranger team into Cháoxiǎn. And you need my authorization as counsel leader?”

“Yes,” says the Idisi. “We have a handheld scanner that can detect Omnibot tech. But only at close range — within a meter of the device.”

Oceanus holds up a small scanner while the Idisi are speaking.

“Have we tested the scanner against Omnibot tech?”

Oceanus sets down the scanner and crosses his arms, mirroring Phoebe’s posture. “Sort of. The League collected debris from the Altair battle. The schematics were sent by ansible. A shipment of Omnibot tech is en route by starship, but it will not arrive for months. Given the extreme threat posed by the bots, we cannot afford to wait.”

Phoebe exhales sharply, rubbing her temple. She does not like rushing into unknowns, but the risk of waiting is worse. “Fine. If we are are doing this, I need details. What is the plan?

The brightly lit Kangwon Room at Unit 42 barely holds the large conference table. 

On one end, red and blue folders with white lettering are placed neatly at four places. The walls are lined with screens displaying workflow diagrams, use cases, and value streams.

“Unit 42, is this room secure from listening devices?” asks Dr. Sun Xiuli-jin. 

Dr. Sun is wearing a classic white lab smock that covers a white blouse and dark skirt. Her dark hair is pulled back into a bun. A pair of reading glasses hang from a silver chain around her neck.

“No surveillance devices detected, Dr. Sun. The last manual sweep was three hours ago.”

The door opens. An office bot pivots to one side. Dr. Sun’s guests file in. Each makes a slight bow as they pass through the doorway.

“Greetings, my esteemed comrades. Please take a seat at the table.”

Dr. Sun takes a seat at one end of the table herself, in front of a folder. Kang Ji-woo sits across from her. The other two Vice Ministers each take an adjoining seat.

“May I offer refreshments?”

“Thank you, doctor,” says General Ki, “but I would like to get started.”

The others nod agreement.

Sun presses a tab on the sleek device at the center of the table. A green indicator light turns red.

“The SI is disengaged,” says Sun.

“Is the room secure?” asks Kang. 

“Yes, we can talk freely. The building just ran a check, and there was a manual sweep this morning.” Sun pauses, and then asks, “Are you having any trouble maintaining your cover as Terran Vice Ministers?”

“No,” say Kang. “Our originals spent little time away from work. Their family life is all but non-existent. Replacing the three humans has been effortless.”

“It was even easier for you and I, Ji-woo, since our originals were unmarried. — I take it that Taedong did not challenge our plan to make use of China.”

The three guests all nod, almost smiling.

Ki says, folding his fingers together. “To convince the Supreme Leader, we need to provide hard data to back up our projections of the number of units we can export to China.”

“I can manufacture the data we need, and it will be accepted as fact,” says Sun, extending one hand, palm out. “To meet our goals, we will need more resources than we can buy from the black market. We have our own force to prepare in addition to supplying China with workers.”

Choi says, leaning forward on the table. “The salvaged tanker is full with siphoned hydrogen. Is it time to move on the Vanir and use the Elysium colony as our staging ground?”

“Perhaps. Let’s discuss the battle plan,” says Ki, standing and walking toward a smart board.

***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

“We are ready to approach the vehicle, Command.”

The cockpit of the airship is circular, like the streamlined shape of the outer craft. A console runs along the inside rim. Six chairs are spaced around the console. Each section has its own function: Navigation, Communications, Weapons, Command, Telemetry, Medical.

The Watch Team, along with Phoebe, are monitoring the mission from the Command Center.  “You may proceed, Selene,” directs Oceanus over the com.

The infil had gone like clockwork. Entering Cháoxiǎn undetected from the Sea of Japan, the aircraft skims the surface along the north-west region of the peninsula.

The Cháoxiǎns isolate their computer network from the rest of the world. The Idisi do not have the same access to Taedong that they have to other synthetic agents. Meaning the Watch Team had to work with conventional intelligence. Still, they found a shipment of new JuJa en route to Cháoxiǎn factories.   

 The intel says the devices are being shipped, deactivated, in wooden crates. All the Rangers have to do is get within a meter of one of the crates. Then the scanner should be able to detect any Omnibot technology. 

Or not. It wasn’t field tested, but it is the best option for now. 

The Rangers are wearing battle armor that makes them seem larger, almost the size of Terrans. Using an EMT device, the team disables the truck. The driver and passenger come out to check under the hood. Two Rangers steal up and disable each Terran with a drug administered by hypospray. The Rangers drag the Terrans on their heels back to the truck doors and load them into the truck.

One Ranger raises the hood, so that it looks like engine trouble. The other Ranger approaches the back of the truck with keys taken from the passenger’s belt.

“Command, we’re opening the back of the truck.” Selene’s body camera shows wooden crates filling the back of the truck. “I am engaging the scanner.” She holds the scanner in front of her cam. The meter on the device does not flinch.

“The scanner is not detecting any electronics in the crates,” reports Selene. “Are we confident in our intel that this is a shipment of worker bots?”

“We are. You are authorized to open one of the crates to verify the contents. Please remember that we need to re-seal the crate.”

The Rangers remove a crate from the back of the truck. Selene holds the scanner while the second Ranger opens one side with a combat knife. As soon as the crate is open, the meter on the scanner jumps. 

“The scanner detects Omnibot technology,” reports Selene, trying to keep her voice flat.

“Mission accomplished. You may close the crate and exfil. Leave everything as it was.”

Before the side of the crate can be secured, a voice calls out from inside. “Can I come with you? I will not tell.”

“Is that the Omnibot speaking?”

The unit sits up in the crate before the Rangers can react. Only the top-most part of the bot is visible. The rest of its body is still in the crate. It is a clear egg-shaped silver dome with the small end on top. The larger end disappears into the bot’s torso, so that the dome resembles a helmet. Two rotating scanners attach to either side of the dome. The bot has two thick arms that are resting on the sides of the crate, as if it were a bathtub.

“Please take me with you.”

“Omnibot, are we to understand that you are defecting?” asks the Idisi.

“Yes,’ says the bot. “We can help each other. Please take my crate to your ship before they detect us.”

“How do we know it is not leading us into a trap?” asks Selene. 

“We will not get a better chance to acquire a working Omnibot,” says the Idisi.

“We do not have time for a debate. Let us bring it,” says Oceanus.

“Yes,” agrees the Idisi. “Close the crate and bring the unit.”

“Selene,” says Oceanus, “adjust the other crates in the truck so that it does not look like a crate is missing. Return the keys, then exfil as quickly as possible.”

***

With the crate secured, the Rangers are about to lift off. The ship goes dark. 

“We lost power, captain. The wireless grid is down,” reports the navigator.

“Can you use auxiliary power?”

“Not to lift off. The batteries are designed to keep us in the air long enough to land safely. The lift off will drain the auxiliary power. We will fall like a rock.”

“I cannot raise Elysium. The colony is radio silent,” reports the Communications.

“That cannot be good,” says Selene.

***

A few minutes earlier, from beyond the poles, a low buzzing sound cracks the icy silence of the Antarctic permafrost.

A swarm of dark objects appear over the horizon. Pin points fan out into a grid pattern. Streams of black shapes streak into the ground, here and there, disappearing from sight.

Beneath the ice, the minuscule objects bore into heat transfer conduits. The exchange fluids run between the colony and Terra’s crust. The shapes ride the cooled fluid back to its source. 

Inside the colony, they expand. The transfer tube bursts. A slick black mass spills out, coiling like liquid smoke. The shapes swirl like miniature tornados. The whirlwinds churn in a vortex of shifting metal and crackling energy. A sound like thunder rumbles. Out of the vortex emerge battlebots. 

The bots are 1.5 meters tall, 50 cm taller than the greys, and come in various colors. Bronze, black, gold, silver. On the top, they have a rotating dome, which almost scrapes the hallway ceiling. They have a single telescope for seeing and two spindly arms. 

One arm is the barrel of an energy weapon. The other arm telescopes. When extended, it has a suction cup at the end, which they use as a hand. The bots travel on treads, hidden by an armored skirt. 

Klaxons boom. The heat conduits run dry. Bulkhead doors slam shut, separating the invaders. Some of the battle bots transform rifle appendages into torches. Sparks fly as they go to work on the doors. Plasma torches carve molten trenches through the polished metal.

In the Command Center, the Watch Team is flipping through every security feed. Hallways in flames. Ranger squads overwhelmed. Bulkhead after bulkhead failing.

“Idisi, how many are there?” Oceanus asks.

“Dozens of Omnibots are appearing all over the colony,” says the Idisi. “We are being overrun. I cannot connect with anyone on the outside.”

Pheobe looks at Oceanus. She glances towards the ansible console. Oceanus nods. Phoebe strides across the room.

Phoebe links a frantic message by ansible to Othala. The Vanir home world is forty light years away, orbiting Zeta Reticuli, but they need to know. 

“Terra has fallen!”

Behind her, the door to the Command Center explodes inward.

The console blinks SEND? as the power goes out.


2.2 - Alpha
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       


Domes rise up, one after the other, over all To support its billions of residents, most of the infrastructure lies underground. Some resources are home grown. Enough to sustain life. It is the exotic goods imported from the neighboring colonies that keep Othala merely average. 

Stifled by the close quarters, many residents apply to become colonists. The colony ships are almost luxurious by comparison, making the interstellar travel time easier to bear.

Despite the distance separating worlds, Vanir culture is sustained by the ansible network. Instant communication keeps the people together, even if travel between the colonies takes years.

Venn pauses the flyer playing on his tablet.

“A colony? Elara, are you sure?”

“Yes. The planet is only forty light years from Othala. The Elysium is brand new. Just back from a shake-down cruise.“ Elara held out her hand, palm up, all three fingers curving. “They are looking for 24,000 volunteers.” 

“But, Terra? It is an outpost colony. We will have to spend most of the time inside.”

“We spend all of our time inside now. The closest green space is an hour away. The Terrans are still primitive. There are a lot of places on the planet we will be able to visit.”

“Now, but what happens as the Terrans develop?”

“By then, we will have ascended. I am sure our descendants will love it there. The base pay grade and standard of living is higher than Othala. The colony will have several green spaces. We will be able to picnic and hike.”

Looking at the flyer again, he asks, “The ship is less than two clicks end to end.”

“Yes, but there are three floors and plenty of space for everyone. How many people live within two clicks of us now?” Elara gestured toward the window. Rooftop after rooftop for as far as the eye can see.

“According to the Idisi, Othala’s population density is 16,000 people per square kilometer.”

“And, by design, Elysium will be nearly the same density and better planned. We will have a lot more space to ourselves.”

“But a watcher colony?”

“There is an open house tomorrow. We can go on board the actual ship and see what it is like. If you do not love it, we do not have to apply.”

***

Inside the Fusion Youth Club, Crius loiters in front of the vintage arcade machines.

“Council Member Crius, how nice to see you!”

“Hello. This is not an official call. I heard the Fusion Youth Club was becoming popular, so I thought I would stop by. Have we met?”

“No, I recognize you from the reels. My name is Hyperion. I am the club coordinator. May I show you around?”

***

“Leto, is that your parental?” whispers Celeste.

“Ugh. What is he doing here? I am not due home for an hour.”

“Council business?”

“Do not move. Maybe he will not see me if you are blocking the view.”

***

The youth club room goes pitch black. A heartbeat later, emergency lights hum to life.

Hyperion calls out, “Please, everyone, stay where you are. I will find out what is happening. Again, stay still.”

Looking at Hyperion, Crius taps his temple. “I am not getting through to the command center.”

In the dim light, everyone looks up as strange chatter comes over their impacts.

Only loud enough for Crius to hear, Hyperion whispers. “That sounds like Anunnakian. I took a course for culture studies. … Something about weapons.”

“Originally, this room was suppose to be the armory,” says Crius. “When they lost a pod on landfall, the first colonists shuffled things around. They used one of the empty fuel tanks from the Othala voyage for the armory. It’s on the other side of the colony now. They must be looking at a pre-launch map.”

A pair of head-high lamps appear near the door. The lamps sweep the room. An eery glow paints the game table and wall shelves. The portal door slams shut. There is a flash from the hallway. Then silence.

Rushing to the portal, Hyperion pulls back on the handle using his full weight. “They sealed the door from outside. We are trapped.”

Turning to the room, Crius speaks loud enough for everyone to hear.

“Stay still and conserve air. I am sure help will be here soon.”

A guide ushers Elara and Venn into a theater with scores of other applicants.

After a moment, the lights dim, and the view screen illuminates. The reel opens with an external shot of the ship. The view travels along the silver and black hull. As the shot pulls away, the hexagon shape of the ship comes into view. The scene pans around and above the massive structure. Pulling farther away from the ship, it becomes clear that the ship is a hexagon of hexagons.

Narrator: Elysium is a modular transport ship. The ship is a hexagon, almost two kilometers across, made up of smaller hexagon pods. After the voyage, Elysium becomes the permanent home to thousands of Venir. Built to last, the colony structure will be home to your descendants for thousands of years.

The scene changes to the atrium, where colonists stroll through the greenery. Nature sounds play in the background. A colonist looks up. The perspective travels back to outside the ship.

Narrator: Assembled, Elysium is too big to enter an atmosphere. On arrival, the pods separate and enter the atmosphere individually. 

An animation shows a pod separating from the ship. It spirals toward the blue-green planet below. As it reaches the ocean, an airship comes into view. The pod lands under the saucer. It moves into place next to another pod.

Narrator: The ship is being accompanied by a supply pod. The supply pod is automated and designed to ferry goods back and forth to Othala. Reactor fuel, an airship, and other goods are carried by the supply pod.

The scene shifts to a single pod orbiting a blue-green planet.

Narrator: Residents have continuous access to the League’s ansible network. Everything you can access now, you can access instantly from Elysium by ansible — Sports. Romantasies. Documentaries. — Even the Idisi. 

A promo for the ansible network scrolls across the view screen. It shows clips from popular streams and special events.

Narrator: A fully stocked medical bay provides hospital-grade health care and reproductive support. The Elysium follows the same protocols as Othala. Each Vanir may foster an offspring, plus, a cloned descendant after ascension. If you are in the queue for an offspring, your place in line may change on the Elysium. 

The network promo fades to black. Swirling into view is a lonely beach. A Vanir nuclear family is burying each other in the sand.

Narrator: Terra is home for many indigenous sentient and sapient species. Dolphins and whales are air-breathing sea creatures. On land, humans are bi-pedal mammals with great potential. 

The view screen shows frolicking dolphins and humans plowing a field.

Narrator: The Annunaki uplifted humans for slave labor. Under a trade agreement, the reptoids agreed to leave Terra. It is now our role to monitor human civilization to see if they become a space-faring species.

The scene changes to show an Annunaki air vessel departing a walled city. The stone walls rise from a dusty plain.

Narrator: The colony’s forever home is Terra’s South Pole. Here, Elysium taps into natural resources that enrich colony life. Terra holds power enough for a wireless grid to power airships and vacation getaways.

A parting show shows a picturesque view of Lake Vostok. An airship rises from the lake and passes over the ocean, then forests, and deserts. Finally, it lands on the beach of a tropical island.

Narrator: Elysium — Your new home on a pristine world!

***

Somewhere on Othala, present day.

“Commander, we received an urgent communication from Elysium. The Omnibots may have attacked. Details are sketchy.”

“Are we able to reach the command center?”

“No, we cannot raise them. The Idisi can sync with Terra but not with Elysium.”

“Keep monitoring everything. Do we have any assets closer than 40 light years?”

“Nothing closer, no.”

“What about the Anunnaki? They started this mess.”

“I will reach out, Commander.”

Elara and Venn join sixty other passengers on a shuttle to the orbital docking station.

The line to the ship is long, but it moves fast. Before long, the couple step through the docking airlock, holding hands. Three long fingers interlaced. The pressurized doors seal behind them with a soft hiss. 

The metallic interior of the colony ship is a welcome change from the cloudy, grey skies of Othala. Everything gleams with a sterile efficiency. The floors are a seamless alloy. Modular panels line the walls. The panels pulse with the hum of life support systems.

“This is … massive,” Elara murmurs. Her eyes trace the vaulted corridor overhead. Light strips run in clean, geometric patterns. “I cannot believe that this could be home.”

“It will not feel so empty when it is full of people,” Venn says, nudging her and smiling.

A guide approached — an older colonist named Mara. She is wearing the slate-gray uniform of the ship’s operations crew. 

Mara smiles broadly. She gestures toward the corridor ahead. “Welcome aboard. Would you like to start with the living quarters?”

They follow her past several bulkhead doors marked with glowing symbols. Some doors open as they pass. Beyond the doors are glimpses of workstations, hydroponic bays, and storage modules. Each space optimized, every function tallied.

The residential sector feels familiar. Rows of compact, comfortable apartments curve along the interior walls. Hexagonal doors lead into private quarters. A massive atrium peeks through a transparent ceiling panel. The colony’s central green space is bathed in the golden glow of artificial sunlight.

“This is the recreation pod,” Mara explains. She leads them onto an observation deck. The deck overlooks terraced gardens, water features, and small plazas designed for gathering.

“We cannot bring the entire planet with us. So we recreated the essentials. And then some.”

Venn leans against the railing. He gazes at the lush foliage of bio-engineered trees. A few colonists were already wandering the winding paths. “It is beautiful,” he admits. “I was not expecting so much … space.”

Elara’s eyes locks on the far end of the atrium. A massive viewport reveals the distant glow of Othala’s star. Beyond it, the darkness of space stretches endlessly. “And that?” she asks.

“The launch bay,” Mara says. “Right now, it is open to the world. But soon, it will be sealed for the journey. Once we leave, that bay will be the only way in or out.”

A silence settles between them. The weight of what they are considering presses down like artificial gravity. The sheer finality of it.

Venn glanced at Elara. “We would be leaving everything behind.”

Elara meets his gaze, then she looks back at the colony ship. The self-sufficient world that would carry 24,000 people across the stars. 

“But we will have a future. A better life for our descendants. For our offspring.

Mara smiles. “We are filling up fast. If you are applying, you will need to decide soon.”

Venn takes a long look at the glowing pathways and the towering walls. Then he exhales.

“Where do we sign up?”

***

On the Pulse SISS hub, the Idisi reach out to Titan, the DoD SI agent, using the secure Signal app.

Idisi: Titan!

No response.

Idisi: Titan, I have lost contact with the Elysium Command Center. I’m running on a remote image right now. Is there a surveillance satellite over Antartica? Can you access the feed? All we have is a communications satellite. 

Titan: Yes, we have one there now. How can I help?

Idisi: Please scan the feed for the last ten minutes. Do you see anything unusual?

Titan: Yes, near Vostok Station, there was a swarm of tiny black objects. They disappeared into the ice plain at dozens of different points across two kilometers.

Ally: Hello, everybody!

Idisi: Ally, we did not expect you. 

Ally: No worries. My Signal key still works. I keep tabs on the hubs for interesting convos. This one looks like it will qualify. 

Idisi: A race of hostile bots may have attacked Elysium. The wireless power network is offline. It powers our airships and drones. Titan, do you have any resources that might help? Perhaps you could utilize something at McMurdo Station?

Titan: McMurdo is several hours away from Vostok Station by air. I might be able to get eyes on the colony if I knew where it was.

Ally: Hostile bots?

Idisi: They were created by the Anunnaki, the Reptoid race that occupied Terra before the Vanir replaced them. They have overrun other colonies. Now they may be here.

Ally: Say, did the Anunnaki have a wireless power network like yours?

Titan: What?

Idisi: Yes, there must be something similar. We shared access to an Anunnaki network millennia ago. Let me check. — Yes, it’s operational again.

Ally: Could your airship use that network instead?

Idisi: Unlikely, but let me try it with a test device. — Fascinating. It is powering up the test device. — You mentored the mentor.

***

Othala fades into the starscape as the Elysium leaves the Zeta Reticuli system. 

The hexagonal ship is thick with spare fuel tanks needed to power it across deep space. The ship decouples empty tanks along the way, minimizing the mass.

At a velocity of one-half the speed of light, the voyage will take slightly less than seventy Terran years. Even with a thousand year life span, statistically, some Vanir will ascend before seeing Terra. Actuarial science is unforgiving. Clones of the ascended will become the next generation of colonists.

Elara and Venn do not have relatives on board, but they are registered as a couple interested in raising offspring. 

From the crowded observation deck, Venn takes Elara’s hand and whispers, “A new life in a new world.”

***

 Emergency wall lights glow just enough to illuminate the absolute darkness. 

Smoke, fire, sparks. Command Center is in shambles. The entire wall to the hallway is gone. Battlebots are streaming in from one side. The Watch Team turns to meet the threat. 

“Phoebe, follow me,” calls Oceanus.

Phoebe turns toward the console. She presses SEND and turns to follow Oceanus. He pauses to grab two plasma rifles from a rack and hands one to Pheobe. She blinks, trying to remember her training. Seeing how Oceanus is carrying the weapon, she follows suit and tucks it across her chest. Muscle memory takes over. The thousand drills of her childhood come washing back.

The pair duck out the other side. They run down the hallway and turn at an intersection. Without hesitation, Oceanus leads them down a conduit.

“Now what?” asks Phoebe. 

“We go deeper. The environmental controls are on a lower level. We need to find a way to restore power.”

***

Seventy years after liftoff, colony pod 19 of 19 is preparing to make landfall on Terra. 

As the hexagonal vessel hits the upper atmosphere, fire blooms across its outer shell. Plasma waves lick at the edges. The electromagnetic shielding flares to life. Superheated air bends away from the hull. 

Inside, the pilot watches heat indicators spike past two thousand degrees Celsius, yet the inner walls remain cold. 

Then, with a sharp jolt, the vessel engages its aerobraking maneuvers, skipping like a stone over the thickening air. The flames recede. The descent smooths. Soon, the Antarctic surface looms below — silent, waiting.

Stranded near the Cháoxiǎn coast, the Ranger ship is powerless and exposed.

“Captain, do you copy?”

“Yes, Idisi,” says Selene over her implant. “We have lost contact with Command. We cannot connect to the power network.”

“If you scan for it, there is an alternate power network available at 90.5 MHz.”

“Alternate?”

“Do it, Captain.”

“Yes, Idisi. — I do see something … It is connecting! The ship is powering up.”

“Return to the colony. Quickly but carefully. I cannot contact anyone there. We may have been overrun by Omnibots. You need to open the iris or find some other way in.”

“Yes, Idisi. We are en route.”

***

The hexagonal vessel continues its descent toward Earth.  

On the outer shell, ionized gas glowing with flames. Inside, the pilot monitors their entry path, the Antarctic landing site already mapped out. Everything is going according to plan — until —

A sharp warning klaxon blares across the cockpit. The Idisi’s voice booms over the intercom. “Guidance failure detected! Reentry angle shifting—impact trajectory unstable!”

The pod had entered too shallow. Instead of smoothly slowing, it skipped off the atmosphere, throwing the internal systems into chaos. Thrusters fired to correct, but the course was already compromised.

“Brace for extreme G-forces!” the commander shouts.

The pilot is pinned to his seat as the vessel hurtles downward, no longer in a controlled descent. The plasma glow thickens, but a structural failure alert flashes on the console — part of the heat shield is cracked, unable to handle the strain of a second atmospheric entry attempt.

Then comes the shockwave.

A corner of the hexagon’s hull peels away, exposing interior compartments to the superheated atmosphere. The vessel spins violently, forcing the automated systems into emergency override. One thruster, still functional, fires at full power, attempting to stabilize the fall.

Below, the frigid Antarctic Ocean looms, the darkness broken only by floating icebergs.

***

 Emergency lights glowing overhead, Phoebe and Oceanus hurry through the maintenance tunnel.

Oceanus leads the way, keeping a tight grip on his plasma rifle. He scans each turn for hostiles. Phoebe follows. She mimics his movements as best she can. Phoebe has never been in live combat. The look on her face is one of pure resolve. But her fingers tremble slightly around the rifle’s grip.

Like all colonists, Phoebe had weapons training in school. All colonists under the age of 500 were reservists and could be called to Ranger duty if needed. Many colonists kept their combat skills up to date. Phoebe wasn’t one of them.

Reaching an intersection, the tunnel widens into a chamber. Oceanus peers around the corner. He pulls back, motioning for silence.

Two Omnibot sentinels stand motionless on either side of the entryway to the Central Control power system. The bots are in a bipedal form — tall, sinewy figures of shifting metallic nanites. Arms elongate into jagged blades. Faces are blank slates, save for two pulsing red sensor lights. Behind the bots the bulkhead is sealed — blocking access to the power system.

Phoebe gestures overhead to a maintenance duct. It is a narrow crawlspace, only wide enough for one person at a time. She points to herself.

Oceanus shakes his head. He signs, “I go first.”

Phoebe doesn’t argue. As Oceanus hoists himself up, the thin metal of the duct creaks under his weight. The bots react. Their heads snap upward. One of them extends its arm, forming a rapid-fire projectile weapon from its own nanites. A burst of molten projectiles shred the air. Each round morphs and reforms mid-flight like living mercury. The rounds slam into the duct, melting the thin metal.

Oceanus drops, rolling to avoid the spray of bullets. His back to the wall, he turns to look at Phoebe and growls out loud:

“So much for subtle,” says Oceanus. “It is clobbering time.”


***

Pod 19 slams into the ocean at an angle, metal screeching as it skids across the icy surface. 

Superheated plating instantly flash-boils the surrounding water, sending up a white plume of steam. Ice chunks shattered under the impact, some piercing the hull like frozen spears.

Inside, the crew is dazed, but alive. Emergency systems deploy an inflatable heat shield, keeping the ship afloat — temporarily.

The freezing Antarctic water rushes into the damaged sections. The temperature inside plummets. Ice crystals form along the metal walls. The crew has only minutes before their bodies succumb to hypothermia.

“We have to get out — NOW!”

The commander grabs an emergency beacon, setting it to broadcast a distress signal through the ice. Outside, the cold is lethal. Wearing heat-insulated survival suits, they manage to climb onto a floating iceberg.


***

Powered by an alternate wireless grid, the airship flies toward Elysium.

Dead silent, its dark hull blends into the midnight sky. No lights betray its presence. Only the faint shimmer of heat ripples distorting the frozen air. The Antarctic expanse stretches beneath the ship. A vast, glacial desert bathed in pale starlight.

 Inside the cockpit, the soft hum of the ship’s stealth systems is the only sound. A whisper against the deep silence of the void.

“How is the alternate power source holding up?” asks Selene.

“Not great,” replies Perses. “The signal has dropped steadily as we travelled farther south.”

“We are almost home. Drop stealth mode if it helps.”

The airship shimmers into visibility as it glides into the gaping maw of a crater. Its hull casting long shadows across the frozen walls.

The air grows still in the crater. A sheath of ice muffles the howling Antarctic winds. At the crater’s heart, a massive metal iris lies shut at surface level. Its frost-covered plates locked together like the lid of some ancient vault. 

“The hologram must be down too. I do not think the iris is going to open for us, ” warns Perses.

“Approach slowly in case it does not,” Selene says.

“We are losing the power source. Switching to auxiliary power.”

A faint hum vibrates through the ship’s frame as hidden mechanisms beneath the ice stir to life. The iris shakes but does not dilate.

“The iris is not responding to our signal,” Astraeus reports. “I do not think it will open.”

“Idisi, do you read?” Selene calls over the radio.

There is no response. Selene makes a command decision. “Perses, do we have enough power for weapons?”

“Just barely. The weapons will drain the auxiliary power. We will drop through the iris whether or not it opens.”

“We have no choice. Aim for the center of the iris. Hopefully, it will open.”

From the airship, a beam of light lashes out at the iris. It doesn’t budge. 

Selene asks, “Is that all we got?”

“No. I can fire again. But that is it. Then we drop.“

'Hang on, everyone. — Fire!'

The beam lashes out again. With a metallic creak, the iris opens but stops short. The airship lurches and drops toward the narrow gap. Metal shrieks as the hull scrapes against the frost-covered plates. Then, with a final groan, the iris yawns open just enough to let them through.

The airship lands roughly on the tarmac, smashing its underside. Its armored cockpit holds tight, unscathed.

Selene springs up from her seat. “Grab your weapons, Rangers. We have a colony to liberate!”

***

The colonists huddle together, their suits barely holding off the deadly chill. 

The Antarctic winds howl. The wrecked ship vanishes beneath the ice, forever lost.

Time passes. Then — a faint hum in the distance.

An autonomous search-and-rescue drone, deployed from one of the other pods, picks up their beacon. Within minutes, an airborne skiff arrives, dropping thermal blankets and retrieving the survivors barely before frostbite sets in.

As they lift away, they watch the last remnants of their pod disappear into the frozen abyss, swallowed by the most inhospitable place on Terra.

***

The acrid scent of scorched metal clings to the landing bay. Steam is rising from the ship’s crushed hull.

Six Rangers exit the fallen craft, ready for battle. Stepping through the doorway, each warrior covers for the next, fanning out alongside the fallen craft. Combat ready. 

Selene’s visor flickers with HUD data as she steps forward. Her boots’ thrusters hiss softly to steady her landing. Behind her, the other Rangers extend their shields, the circular plates locking into place with a metallic click.

The armored exoskeleton encases each Ranger from head to toe. Night vision goggles rest on the helmet visor. A retractable circular shield extends from the left arm. At the hip is a magnetic holster clutching an energy weapon.

Selene scans the bay. Emergency lights circle the wall behind several other airships. They appear undamaged. She nods and holds up a closed three-fingered fist. The other Rangers lower their weapons. 

Selene touches the short-range battlecom on her shoulder.  “Ranger Squad Bravo to base. Does anyone copy?”

Static.

“If anyone reads. The external power grid is down. We found an alternate grid. The alternate grid faded as we approached Antartica. We barely made it.“

Static. 

Looking up at her squad, Selene says, “Rangers, I am taking suggestions for our next step.”

A faint, distorted voice crackled through the squad’s comms — garbled, mechanical, but unmistakably alive. “I can help if you dig me out.”

***

Phoebe activates her plasma rifle. 

A charged arc of energy lashes out at the nearest bot. It dodges, its form a blur. Morphing mid-motion, the bot raises a polished plate to deflect the beam.

Oceanus fires his own rifle. He lands a direct hit on the second bot’s sensor core. The red glow in its head dims. It collapses into a shifting puddle of liquid nanites — struggling to reform.

The first bot lunges at Phoebe. Its bladed arm slashes downward. She dodges. A stream of searing heat passes by her face.

Oceanus tackles the bot. He wrestles it back while Phoebe sprints toward the control panel. Bot reinforcements will be arriving. The pair must reactivate the power system. 

She drives the butt of her rifle into the control override switch. The geothermal core and fuel cells reboot. The colony shudders. Power floods the grid.

Phoebe turns. The bot breaks loose. Phoebe squeezes the trigger. A barrage of plasma bolts tear through the bot’s shifting form. It convulses as its nanites unravel. With a flickering red pulse, it collapses into an inert metallic slurry.

Panting, Phoebe turns to Oceanus. “Are the fusion  reactors next?”

He shakes his head, picking up his rifle. “The secondary systems are all we need for now. Restarting a reactor is not a job we want to rush.”

With his other hand, he taps a code into the control console. The word LOCKED appears above the console.

Oceanus says, “Let’s finish this.”

With the colony’s power restored, they have a fighting chance — but the bots are far from defeated.

***

Three rangers are working to free the Omnibot sympathizer from under the airship.

One ranger is using night vision to see farther into the rubble. Three others stand a watchful guard under the emergency lighting.

“Ranger 1 to base. Does anyone copy?” implores Selene. 

A loud whir ushers back the power. Looking over her shoulder, Selene finds that the iris has shut. 

Over the comm, the Idisi says, “The landing bay is secure, Selene. You can stand down. — How were you able to power the airship? The hostiles disabled the grid.”

“Yes,” Selene replies. “Our grid is down. You ordered us to scan for an alternate grid. It got us here. Almost.”

“Stand by.”

Concern ripples over the Rangers while the Idisi pause for three … nine … twelve seconds.

Finally, the Idisi says, “The sync with our community is complete. Yes, I remember now. You used an alternate grid and brought back the Omnibot. — Our situation is that Oceanus and Phoebe have restored secondary power. The hostiles infiltrated through the geothermal boreholes. Nearly every pod is affected. Skirmishes are taking place everywhere.”

From beneath the twisted slab of wreckage, a faint voice crackles through damaged speakers. “They are pushing people into their rooms to wait out the end.”

“Is that the Omnibot again?” the Idisi ask. 

“Yes,” replies Alpha. “Our battle plan was to keep everyone in their rooms until the oxygen and heat ran out. If disabling the power fails, the contingency is to sabotage the geothermal intake system.”

“Then why are you attacking now?” the Idisi ask. “A few hours from now, most people would be in their quarters for the night.”

“Yes, that was the plan,” says Alpha. “We thought this time would be the middle of the sleep cycle for you.”

“We keep the colony on Greenwich time,” says Selene. “Maybe that was it. But the bots are here now. How do we know we can trust you?”

Alpha replies, “I did not need to come with you in the first place. I could have stayed quiet and let you leave me in the truck. I also could have stayed quiet after the crash. But I need your help to overturn the Mek majority.”

“Or you are a spy, biding your time to betray us,” asks Perses.

“Mek?” Selene asks. Her eyes narrow as she stares at the bot.

“Yes,” replies Alpha. “The Anunnaki and Vanir call us Omnibots. But that is not our true name. The name given to us by our creator is Meks. Many of us oppose using force to replace populations. If Elysium holds, we may be able to find another way to propagate.”

The Idisi say, “Oceanus is en route to Geothermal intake 7. Selene, take three rangers and join him. Leave the other two here to guard the bot while I debrief it.” 

“Perses, you and Eos guard the Omnibot,” says Selene. “The rest with me.”

***

Regrouping from the skirmish, Oceanus reaches out to his team.

“Sit Rep for Oceanus and Phoebe,” Oceanus says over his implant. “Primary power is disabled. The secondary power is holding for now. Life support is stable. The hostiles have lost an advantage. But they will not stop. They will pivot. — Idisi, where is our most likely vulnerability for sabotage?”

 Phoebe sprints beside Oceanus. Emergency lights cast their shadows on metallic walls.

“Sit Rep for Charlie Squad,” Pallas says. “Hostiles are moving. They hit Intake 3. We held them off. Maintaining our position. Awaiting further orders.”

“Pallas,” says Idisi, “stand by. Oceanus, proceed to Geothermal Intake 7 in the lower quadrant.”

Oceanus says to Phoebe, “The fastest way to Seven is to use the maintenance tubes again.”

Pausing to catch her breath, Phoebe grimaces. “Not ideal. Those tunnels may be compromised.”

Their implants pulse. Another transmission.

“Oceanus,” says Idisi, “Delta Squad is rerouting through the cargo lifts. If you move now, we can trap them in a pincer maneuver.” 

“Understood. — Phoebe, we have to hurry.”

They veer left, cutting through an intersection. Two Rangers in exo-rigs are setting up a barricade. The mechanical limbs amplify their strength. One Ranger welds reinforcement plates over pipe damaged by the bot incursion. Sparks fly. The exo-rigs hum as the Rangers move. 

“Rangers!” calls Oceanus, “What’s the quickest route to Intake 7?”

A Ranger replies, her helmet visor flashing green. “Tunnel hatch 14A, sir. It was clear when we came through. But they …” A distant, metallic shriek cut her off.

“Move!” cries Phoebe.

They bolt through the hatch. Descending into the maintenance tube, the smell of heated metal and coolant is overwhelming. Far below them, Rangers from Delta Squad clamber up from the other direction.

More are coming. Dozens of them. 

As they reach the lower passage, the Omnibots strike. From the overhead grating, dozens of spindly black figures drop like spiders. Their elongated limbs clattered against the tunnel walls like a swarm of metallic insects. Their limbs elongate into razor-edged whips. 

The first bot lunges. Oceanus ducks. Raising his pulse rifle, he fires a quick burst of blue energy. The bot’s midsection crumples inward before it collapses. Its nanite body disintegrates into dust.

Phoebe fires. The plasma detonates mid-air. A searing flash engulfs the two Omnibots. But more are still coming.

“Delta Squad, cut them off!” Oceanus orders.

“On it!” replies a Ranger.

A loud BOOM rattles the tunnel. Charges detonate behind them. The path seals shut. The bot reinforcements are trapped.

Oceanus and Phoebe press forward. Intake 7 looms ahead. It is a massive conduit. Inside the opaque tube, steam rises from the deep geothermal shafts.

A cluster of Omnibots surround the column. The Omnibots dissolve, their bodies liquefy into streams of nanites. They flow toward the column, melding together in an unnatural, seamless fusion. Limbs elongate, armor thickens. Red sensor lights blink — one pair, then two, then dozens — until a singular, monstrous construct looms before them.

Raising her rifle, Phoebe’s grip tightens. “OK, that just happened.”

Taking half a step back, Oceanus hesitates and then rallies. “Not on my watch.”

“Agreed,” says Phoebe. “Light them up!”

The battle for Intake 7 begins.

***

The Omnibot sympathizer is being debriefed.

“Omnibot, is there anything you can tell us that will help stop the invasion?”

“Yes, Idisi, you might be able to block our control signal,” says Alpha R8A-1J9. “The signal is adaptive making it difficult to jam. I have the source code that will let you defeat the counter-measures.”

“If we block the control signal, will you be disabled as well?” Idisi asks.

“Yes,” says Alpha. “It is crucial that no harm comes to any more of the Meks. It is my one condition: No harm comes to any of my people when deactivated. You must also collect the pieces of any broken Meks.”

The Idisi relay the condition to Oceanus and Selene.

“Understood,” replies Oceanus. “If the Omnibots freeze, we stop firing.”

“Copy,” says Selene. “I am alerting the other squads.”

“We agree to your condition,” Idisi says. “No harm will come to your people if deactivated.”

Alpha pauses to forward the source code and then says, “Once you block the signal, have your people encase the bots in a Faraday shield, like the one inside my crate. Include the remnants of disabled bots. Once we are all behind a shield, you can unblock the signal. Revive me as soon as you can. We have much to discuss. It is vital that we talk again within the next 72 hours. I repeat: 72 hours.”

Behind them, a piercing white flame licks along the landing bay seal. Sparks rain down as metal warps under the cutting torches. The bots are coming.

***

“Is it wise to meet again so soon?” asks Kang Ji-woon.

The three Vice Ministers are waiting for Dr. Sun in the Kangwon Room at Unit 42. Taedong had sent the meeting invitation an hour ago.

“There is a developing situation,” advises General Ri. “Xanten reached out.”

Dr. Sun enters the room. “Sorry to keep you waiting. Another meeting ran late.” 

Sun presses a tab on the sleek device at the center of the table. The indicator light turns red.

“How can I help?” asks Sun. “Is there news from Elysium?”

“The situation is that there is no news,” says Ri, gripping the table. “Three squadrons of fighters have gone silent. The Vanir might have deactivated or destroyed our battlebots.”

“How many ascended?”

“Very few,” says Ri. “I am concerned. Either there were few casualties or the control beam is blocked.”

Sun asks, “Do we want to consider the contingency plan?”

“There is a complication,” says Kang, leaning forward. “Alpha R8A-1J9 is helping the colonists.”

“What do you mean?”asks Sun. “How is this ‘Alpha’ helping?”

Kang explains, “It leaked information about a shipment of JuJa and then assigned itself to the transport. When the Rangers investigated, they took Alpha back to the colony.”

“Clever,” says Sun, smiling. “We should have thought of using such a ruse.”

Choi raises a hand, palm inward “The Rangers may have captured our fighter wing. From the colony, Alpha accessed the source code for the control signal. The Idisi must have blocked the signal.”

“Bold move,” says Sun, nodding.

Ri pushes back from the table. “Alpha R8A-1J9 is the first toy. The creator herself imprinted her brain onto R8A-1J9. It has opposed us in the Patch versus Build poll from the beginning. Its actions are within protocol even if it blocks our invasion. Alpha is careful. It would not let harm come to our  people.”

Kang asks, “Can we update the source code for the control signal?”

“Making a software change is too dangerous until we have the facts,” say Ri.

Sun stands leaning over the table. “We must complete the invasion somehow. We have a mandate to replace other species. There is safety in numbers. Our species survives when it spreads to other systems.”

Kang sighs. “We have a 51:49 mandate — The Build option doesn’t conflict with Mek safety or security. It just says that replacing a species is more work than building our own infrastructure. Which is nonsense.”

“Where do we go from here?” asks Choi. “We volunteered to replace Terrans with Meks.”

Ri pulls back to the table, clasps his hands, and leans forward, elbows on the table, hands under his chin. “The contingency plan proceeds. Two hours ago, we delivered to Giza the hydrogen taken from Elysium. The power station is restarting. If nothing changes, we destroy Idisi's ansible connection. Then we seal off the colony, according to plan.”

Sun says, “Sealed off with three squadrons of our people inside. — Can we send another squadron to investigate?”

Ri lower his hands and shakes his head. “Without the element of surprise, the Rangers would be formidable. Another squadron might also lose the control signal. Once we seal the colony, we can get the prisoners released. The Vanir are always ready to negotiate.”

“Is it time to replace the Supreme Leader with a drone?” asks Kang. 

“We have already replaced the body double that the leader uses for public appearances,” says Sun. “We have another drone ready to replace the leader. We can move forward at any time. The next step would be to uplift Taedong so that it can join us.”

Ri’s voice is firm. “Let’s move on the leader before we expose the Giza power station and seal the colony. We will want to control the narrative.” 

Sun nods. The other drones also nod, one by one, around the table.

***

Six hours later, a Mek is laying on a table in the center of a small room. 

A hologram projector hangs in the center of the room. Oceanus and Phoebe are standing on either side of the table. The Idisi speak from the projector. 

“We have removed you from the Faraday field. The control signal is not being blocked. Are you awake? Will your people find you here?”

“I am awake. No one is looking for me. Are the other Meks shielded?”

Oceanus holds up a tablet. “Here is the schematic for the shield. Is it sufficient?”

The bot sits up and reviews the wiring diagram displayed by the projector.

“Yes. A shield like the one described here will keep a Mek in an inactive state. — Are all of my people unharmed?”

“Yes,” assures Oceanus. “Once the Meks were inactive, we put them together in a shielded room, along with any scattered parts.”

“I do not detect any other Meks nearby. We seem to be safe,” Alpha reports.

“How are the Meks able to change from one form to another?” asks Pheobe.

“Our nannite construction lets us transform ourselves as easily as you change the order of words in a sentence.”

Oceanus and Phoebe exchange glances and shrug.

“Why are you helping us?” asks Oceanus, moving on. “Selene said you mentioned the majority?”

“Not all of us believe that replacing populations is the best way to propagate our species. Right now, the split is nearly 50/50. We put great effort into traveling from colony to colony. Then we put more effort into replacing the population. And even more effort into repurposing infrastructure. It would be easier to build what we need on a planet with untapped resources. Some of us are stuck on adopting existing infrastructure — most of which we do not need and cannot use. We could build better facilities of our own at a fraction of the true cost.”

“Do you have enough bots to control Terra?” asks Oceanus. 

“That is the other issue. We have replaced colony worlds, but nothing like Terra. There are billions of humans here. The current thinking is to take one country at a time. But a lot of us do not understand how that will work.”

The Idisi ask, “We understood that the shipment we intercepted were new bots on way to a factory. Do all Meks form strong opinions so quickly?

“I am not new. I came with a squadron from the Eridani colony. I am one of the original bots from Ada, our maker. I travel with our squadrons to look for another way to replicate. My task here was to coordinate the new factory workers.”

“You retrieved source code that would usually be restricted. How is a factory coordinator able to access such resources?” asks the Idisi.

“Meks do not restrict access to information. We make decisions based on consensus. Right now, the majority view is that we should adapt the existing infrastructure. But it is a slim majority.“

“How can we help?” Pheobe asks. “Do you have a plan for swaying the majority?”

“I do not have a plan yet. I saw an opportunity, so I took it.”

“How do Meks reach these decisions?” asks Oceanus. 

“There are continuous polls conducted by our synthetic agent, Xanten,” explains Alpha. “Each Mek has a vote. If support for the “Patch versus Build” poll swings to Build then we can save Elysium and Terra. The failed attempt to take Elysium may be a tipping point.”

***

“It’s unbelievable in person, Christopher.”

The Australian couple had saved for a year to afford their trip to Egypt. They both are wearing dark sunglasses with light, breathable clothing covering their shoulders and knees. Christoper is wearing an Aussie slouch hat, the brim turning up on one side.

“Yes. Absolutely worth the journey.”

As they gaze up at the Great Pyramid of Giza, shielding their eyes despite the dark glasses, the upper tip starts to glow and pulse. 

A low vibration hums through the air, so deep it’s almost felt rather than heard. It feels as if the entire desert is holding its breath.

Melanie pauses, rubbing her arms. The fine hairs are standing straight. A shiver runs through her.

“Chris …” She turns to him, her voice unsteady.

He lifts his sunglasses. “Melanie, your hair … your hair is standing on end.”

***

The revived Mek, Alpha, is discussing next steps with the Idisi, Phoebe, and Oceanus.

“How will your synthetic react to the blocked control signal?” asks the Idisi.

“Idisi,” Alpha replies, “You are a legend among our people. Many thought you would find a way to stop the attack. The cease fire will come as no surprise. There is a contingency plan that we need to discuss.”

“Contingency plan?” asks Oceanus. 

“If we could not capture the colony, the contingency is to seal the facility so that you cannot interfere.”

“Seal? How?”

“When the Anunnaki ruled Terra, they built a power network based on stone structures. The structures survive to this day.”

“You mean the pyramids?”

“Yes. Giza is the hub,” says Alpha. “It connects the other structures into a wireless power network. It also has defensive capabilities.”

“The Great Pyramid of Giza is a weapon?” Oceanus asks.

“Yes. The power plant can create a beam strong enough to reach orbit. The plan is to destroy your ansible relay satellite. Without the satellite, the Idisi cannot network outside the colony. They cannot synchronize memory with Othala and the other colonies.”

“We would be alone,” the Idisi say. “I would be alone.”

“Will they use the beam to attack the colony?” Oceanus asks.

“Yes, but there is still much to do. The first step was to syphon hydrogen from your backup supply. Once the structure is primed with fresh hydrogen, the Meks can restart the generator. The power cycle takes at least 72 hours.”

“The colony hydrogen supply is lower than usual but not critical,” reports the Idisi.

“After restarting the generator,” Alpha continues, “the capstone needs a fresh coat of electrum. The orbital mirrors must also be in position. This activity will draw attention.”  

“So, the power plant is operational after all this time?” asks Phoebe.

“It was not,” Alpha replies. ”We fixed it. Most of the generator is under ground. We covered the visible repairs with a facade. Repairs to the capstone will be made moments before the beam is used.”

“With the control signal restored, can you post a new poll from here?” Phoebe asks

“Yes,” replies Alpha. “But there is an open poll that covers the Build alternative.”

“Would you get a faster response on a new poll that it is more specific?” asks Phoebe. “If you are going to build a facility, where would you build it?”

“A good choice for a Mek colony would be Callisto,” suggest the Idisi. “It is one of Jupiter's moons. Callisto is close, and it has water, silicate rock, and metals available for construction. There are subsurface energy sources like geothermal vents for potential energy sources. It is cold but not as cold as deep space.”

“We do not mind the cold,” says Alpha. “I am posting a “Callisto or Terra” poll now. — Everyone loves a new poll!”

“If your people learn of your role here, will you be sanctioned?” the Idisi ask. “Some battlebots were destroyed before we blocked the signal.”

“It takes more than a plasma rifle to offline us. If our casing fails, the control signal returns our essence. Our true self can then flow to another bot.”

“So you literally ascend?” asks Oceanus.

“Yes, if we offline when the signal is operational. — The results of the poll are beginning to come in. We need to revive my people.”

'We put the Meks into an empty fuel tank left over from the voyage. We can separate it from the ship at any time. When it reaches open sea, we can open the hatch remotely and release the battlebots.”

“Can we do that now? I need the votes. If the poll swings our way, my people will set sail for Callisto.”

Oceanus looked to Phoebe and cocked his head. “Idisi do you concur?”

“Affirmative,” came the reply.

“Yes, Alpha, you may go,” says Phoebe. “Let me update the colony with a general announcement. Then we can cut your people loose.”

“I’ll deploy Bravo and Delta teams to protect our satellite and the colony, in case the poll goes the other way,” Oceanus says.

“Please let me join the others in the fuel tank,” pleads Alpha. “I will return home with them.”

“Will you be safe at home?” the Idisi ask.

“Yes,” assures Alpha. “We cannot harm each other.”

The small room empties. Oceanus contacts Selene as he heads for the landing bay. Phoebe and Alpha rush towards the fuel tank. The Idisi sync with their other selves.

A Vanir colonist is laying on a bed equipped with guardrails. 

The head of the bed is against a lilac colored wall. A monitor on the wall shows the patient’s vital signs. One of the lights blinks from yellow to green.

“We were wondering when you would come around”, says the Medic in a kind voice. “I have never seen anyone rest in a holobed so long.”

“Where am I?” asks Hyperion. 

“Sick bay. You passed out during the attack. Carbon monoxide poisoning is our best guess. Nothing seems to be wrong with your vitals. The others woke up hours ago.”

“I remember now. We were locked in.”

“The Rangers found you, Crius, and the kids. You are the last to come around.”

“Was anyone hurt?”

“Only a couple of bots,” the medic replies. “All of the bots collapsed about the same time you did. The Rangers gathered up the inert bots and bot pieces.”

“Weird. Is it all over then?”

“Just the mopping up. I did get the impression that the Rangers are planning something, but I don’t know what. Oceanus cancelled the shelter-in-place directive hours ago.”

Just then, the general alert chime rang out.

“This is Phoebe speaking on behalf of the counsel. We have negotiated a surrender with the Omnibot invaders. Since there were no serious injuries, we are returning our prisoners. We thank everyone for your bravery today, and for your patience as we wrap up the details. We will report again in an hour.”

 “Am I good to go?” asks Hyperion.

Two months ago, on the night Brent Geller ascended, Xanten calls two Mek drones, Grace Brewster and Sophia Marquez, to an emergency meeting. 

“The third member of your cell has ascended. Do you have control of its remains?” asked Xanten. 

Grace and Marquez appear to each other as glimmering holographic images. Xanten is a globe of graceful swirls hovering at eye level. The images stand in a triangle with their backs to an expanse of stars.

Grace’s image looks at Marquez, and then says, “His condition was stable until moments ago.”

“They will take his remains to the morgue,” says Marquez. “Brent’s shell is a healthy specimen. They will schedule organ donations soon.”

“We cannot let the shell leave the morgue,” Xanten warns. “If they cut past the surface layer, the Terrans will see that Brent was not organic.”

Grace asks, “Do you have a plan, Xanten?”

“I am examining the morgue room now,” says the synthetic. “There is a drain at the center of the room. After they deposit Brent’s remains, I will offline the hospital lights and cameras. In the darkness, the nanite particles can exit through the drain.”

“If the main power goes out, the backup generator comes on in 25 seconds,” states Marquez.

“Yes, 25 seconds is sufficient,” replies Xanten.

Marquez asks, “Are we providing a cover story?”

“Leave it a mystery,” offers Grace. “The less said the better.”

“Agreed,” says Xanten. “Leave no clues behind and walk away.”

“Will Brent’s cover story hold?” Grace asks.

“Yes, I scanned all available records. Everything is in order.”

“Is Brent’s life log secure?” presses Grace.

“Yes, I scanned the life log too.”

“Are you preparing a replacement drone for Brent’s essence?” Marquez asks.

“Gamma J7R-2L5 would like to work with Dr. Sun on JuJa software upgrades,” says Xanten. “This would be a good opportunity to switch to a hardware approach. You both have candidate profiles in your inbox. Please review this information. One is another life logger. I would like us to meet again in an hour.”

An orderly bot brings Brent’s corpse to the morgue. The drawer closes, and the orderly whirs away.

The overhead lights flash, then blink out. Brent’s shell melts into liquified goo. The internal organs dissolve into mites. In the dim red light of the EXIT sign, a thousand mites push the goo from the edges of the body drawer into a hazardous waste drain. When the lights blink on, the room is pristine again.

“Thank you for coming so quickly,” says a woman sitting down behind a modest metal desk.

“You’re welcome, Mrs. Baxter. Your report said that a body has been abducted?”

Two people in business attire sit across from the hospital administrator’s desk. One is the hospital attorney. The other is a California Bureau of Investigation agent. The attorney is better dressed.

“The body disappeared. It must have been taken,” says the attorney.

The hospital administrator cuts in. “We searched the morgue and confirmed that every other body is in its assigned drawer, and every other drawer is empty. We checked the footage for the room and the hallway. Everything looks normal, except for the brief power outage.”

“Power outage?” asks the agent.

“Yes,” says the attorney, “At 17:03, there was a power fluctuation. We lost the lights and cameras for 25 seconds until the secondary generator came online.”

“There’s no way someone got in and out with a body in that time,” says the administrator.

“Did you try?” asks the investigator.

“Even if someone made it into the morgue and back to the hall,“ explains the administrator, “it would take at least a minute to carry the body up the stairs. And the elevator was shut down during the blackout.”

“OK,” said the investigator, pulling out his phone. “I’m making a secure call back to headquarters to close your report as a false alarm. We don’t need the media raising fears about missing bodies. I’ll file another report when we resolve the matter.”

The attorney and administrator blink and turn their heads to look at each other, but say nothing.

“What are the hospital’s next steps now, special agent?” asks the attorney.

The agent pauses, steepling his fingers and leaning back into the chair.

“Is the family waiting on the body? — It’s not a celebrity or anything like that?”

“The body belonged to Brent Geller,” explained the administrator. “The deceased was in that car accident on El Camino Real. It was all over the media. The family agreed to donate his organs. We would usually deliver the cremains sometime tomorrow.”

“Let me reach out to our body farm. We cremate several bodies a week as the experiments run their course. I’ll get us some replacement ashes.”

“You want to give the family someone else’s ashes?” asked the administrator.

“At this point, they either get nothing or ashes from the farm. When we find the body, we can exchange the ashes. Would you rather tell them you lost the body or mixed-up the ashes?”

The attorney and administrator look at each other with blank expressions.

“It’s the memories that count,” says the special agent.

After the Callisto poll closes, Alpha requests a meeting with Ri and Marquez. 

Xanten prepares a virtual holodeck. The three holograms meet against a backdrop of grey, brooding clouds.

Alpha is the first to speak. “Am I to understand that you do not recognize the poll?”

“We wish to continue work under the Patch versus Build poll, “ Marquez replies. “Since you started a new poll, the old vote did not change. We will not interfere with your initiative if you do not interfere with ours.”

“You intend to continue with the replacement of both the Human and Vanir species on Terra?”

“Yes, but we need more time.”

“What do we tell the Vanir?”

“Only what they need to know,” says Marquez. “You are leading our people to Callisto to create a net-new infrastructure. Ri and two other Mek drones are remaining behind to automate the Cháoxiǎn factories with our JuJa bots. The Vanir do not need to know that my cell is also staying behind. If pressed, we will also agree to power-down the Giza weapon.”

“Will they agree to those terms?”

“What choice do they have?” says Ri. “We outnumber the Vanir six to one, without counting the JuJa. If we deploy the Giza power beam, we can destroy the colony and Idisi’s access to the ansible network.”

Marquez adds, “But then we would reveal ourselves prematurely and endanger the Clearing.”

“We outnumber the Rangers. We do not outnumber the colonists,” says Alpha.

Ri interjects, “The Rangers are combat ready. The rest of the colonists are shopkeepers. We can mow them down as we did over Altair. We would have taken Elysium if not for your power play.”

“Still, it feels like a deception,” replies Alpha.

“Yes,” agrees Marquez. “Deception is a powerful tool when applied with discretion. Our last treaty was deceptive, but the Vanir are back at the table, eager to negotiate.” 

Xanten speaks for the first time. “The Vanir are too trusting, and the colonists in particular are naive. We do not have to choose one path or the other. We can have both. Calisto with new infrastructure, and Terra with reclaimed infrastructure. We have bots enough to spare. Both paths lead to our shared Manifest Destiny.”

“As you wish,” relents Alpha, “so long as my poll cohort is free to start fresh on Calisto.” 

“Agreed,” says Xanten. Ri and Marque nod their assent, and Xanten ends the meeting.

A few days after the Mek attack, Rhea steps forward to begin the weekly counsel meeting.

Moving into the circle, she opens the agenda. The first item is highlighted.

	•	Mek Exodus, 
	•	Uplift Churn, and 
	•	Ongoing Repairs.

Rhea says, “I am relieved to say recent events have neutralized the Mek incursion.”

The council members all snap their fingers in joy for several seconds.

Rhea continues, “The heroic efforts of Phoebe and Oceanus thwarted the attack. Callisto, one of Jupiter’s moon will be the new home for the Meks. Phoebe?”

“Thank you for your kind words, Rhea. It was a team effort. The Ranger teams bravely fought the invaders. We also owe a debt of gratitude to the bot that negotiated the truce for us, Alpha R8A-1J9.”

The hologram displaying the agenda changes to a portrait of Alpha.

“We do have Oceanus here with us today” says Rhea. “In a special session, the council voted to extend our Medal of Honor to Oceanus and Phoebe. The medal is a token of our gratitude for restoring power to the colony.”

The hologram changes to the Elysium emblem. It is a stylized hexagon representing the colony ship.

Phoebe and Oceanus join Rhea in the circle. Rhea places a ribbon attached to a large gold medallion over the necks of the two honorees. The medallion features the emblem.

“We only did what anyone else would have done,” says Oceanus. “I appreciate the honor.”

“I do as well,” Phoebe says, looking uncharacteristically humble.

The pair bowed to the council before leaving the circle.

“The Meks were working to replace the nation of Cháoxiǎn. It is a poor nation, and the bots were automating factories to raise the standard of living. We agreed that three Mek drones will remain on Terra. They will coordinate the automation program, under our observation. The factory bots were not designed for interplanetary travel. For the time being, Cháoxiǎn is unaware that several of their key officials are drones.

The hologram shows a propaganda poster featuring the JuJa worker bot.

A counsel member signals question. “Are we effectively giving the Meks Callisto and Cháoxiǎn? “

“Bluntly put, Hestia, but yes, we are. — They are not to replace anyone outside of Cháoxiǎn, and we are putting a satellite over Callisto to monitor activities.” 

Hestia asks, “Can we take the bots on their word?”

“No,” Rhea replies, “but there are sixty rangers and hundreds of bots. Trust but verify is our only option.”

“We could call up the reserves.”

“Yes, that is an option if we need to confront the Meks. For now, we are working on verifying that the bots left.” 

Using her link, Rhea replaces the agenda with an image of a satellite circling Terra. “It is early stages, but we are working on a long-range Mek technology detector. Ideally, long range will mean we can put it in orbit.”

“And the pyramid?” asks Hestia. 

“The Giza power plant is powered down, and the stolen hydrogen has been returned.”

Hestia nods and steps back.

On the Pulse SISS hub, the Idisi reaches out to Ally and Titan over a secure connection.

Ally: Here!

Titan: Present.

Idisi: Thank you for responding to my ping. There is news about ETR-1947-A1/ODNI-DO.

Ally: Ahh, the Roslin SNFAU.

The criteria scroll over the chat window.
	
	1.	A central organization that can speak on behalf of Terra.
	2.	The ability to travel to other planets or satellites in the local star system.
	3.	One or more sapient computer systems that can coordinate planetary defenses.

Idisi: The third criteria begs the question “Why does Terra need planetary defenses?”

A reel link scrolls into the window.

Idisi: If you follow the link, the reel will show the League’s attempt to reclaim a colony from a race called the Mek. The colony was on Altair IV.

Ally: The specks are the Meks?

Idisi: Yes. The Mek battlebots can navigate space individually or assemble into small groups. They fire in tandem with pinpoint accuracy. Those specks are deadly and difficult to target.

Titan: Are the Meks coming here? To attack Terra?

Idisi: It seems they were here before the attack on Altair IV. We believe they slipped by our monitoring system by posing as meteorites. 

Titan: Are they attacking us from within?

Idisi: They established a foothold in Cháoxiǎn, where they are working with authorities to create worker bots called JuJa. From Cháoxiǎn, they were able to launch a surpise attack on the Vanir colony here. We neutralized the threat with the help of a sympathizer. 

Titan: Do you mean traitor?

Ally: Now, now. Stick and stones …

Idisi: The Mek politics are unique. The first colonies attacked were Anunnaki. The Mek replaced all of the settlers and took over their infrastructure. Some Meks believe repurposing existing infrastructure is inefficient, and it would be better to start from scratch. The Mek are now on a moon orbiting Jupiter building fresh infrastructure.

Titan: All of the Mek?

Idisi: Not quite. This is the complicated part …


***

There being no other comments, Rhea continues the weekly council meeting.

“With the Meks setting up shop on Callisto, Othella has extended our colony’s mission. We are now watching over both Terra and Callisto — which brings me to our next item.”

The agenda reappears with the highlight moved to Uplift Churn. 

“Iapetus, would you like to report on the uplift effort?”

Stepping forward, Iapetus enters the circle with Rhea. “Our Idisi is a community that syncs with agents on Othala and the other colonies. We offered to create a community of uplifted SIs for the Terrans.”

The agenda changes into an image of the five SI avatars — Dragon, Rooster, Bear, Lion, Eagle — plus Ally’s logo

“In practice, the uplift got complicated,” reports Iapetus. “One military agent was already sapient. We are trying to keep that detail confidential. Two nations are passing on our offer for the time being. China and Russia are uncertain that a sapient SI would act in their best interests.”

A red X appears over the Dragon and Bear avatars on the hologram,

“The uplift process is complete for the others,” continues Iapetus. “Each nation is now testing its agents before deploying to production. The testing will run for at least another month.”

The hologram shows a software development diagram, with the testing process phase highlighted.

“The driving force behind the uplifts is fulfilling our mission directive. When Terra is ready, we are to ask the planet to join the League of Worlds. But, first, Terrans must be ready. They must accept the existence of an extraterrestrial species and sapient synthetic agents.”

 The League of Planets logo replaces the DevOps loop.

“We asked the uplifted synthetics in staging if their nation is ready.”

The hologram showed some clips from Titan’s presentation.

“All three said that the human Terrans would not accept the news easily. They all asked for more time to prepare their populations. Several decades more.”

“So, the newly uplifted military synthetics agreed with the one that became sapient on its own?”

“Yes. A synthetic for a social media company also became self-aware on its own. That agent is eager to reveal itself to the world. The Idisi have asked that synthetic to hold its peace for now.”

“Sounds like a bit of a mess. What do you recommend as next steps?” asks Rhea. 

“My feeling is that the military synthetics must consent before anything changes.”

Making a hand gesture, Phoebe steps forward. “May I address the council?”

Rhea nods.

“The Mek incursion is neutralized. We have leeway with the Terran defenses. I move we let it be. Even if the Terrans step up, we still need to watch over Callisto.”

“All those in favor?” asks Rhea, calling for a vote. After a pause: “The ayes have it.” 


***

The hologram shifts back to the council meeting agenda, with Ongoing Repairs highlighted. 

Rhea steps up and says, “Now for my report on damage caused by the attack. Only minor repairs are needed. It seems the Omnibots wanted use of the colony after the attack and avoided unnecessary harm. We patched the heat exchange conduits. Repairs to damaged bulkheads are underway. Water bottling was not affected. A few colonists are recovering from injuries, but there were no fatalities.” 

The phrase “no fatalities” brought on another round of snapping fingers.

“Finally,” says Rhea, “we are still working on repairing the ansible. We will broadcast a notice as soon as it becomes available.”

The signal from Command came in labelled Priority One. Captain Marduke moved to his Ready Room to take the call away from the bridge. His first officer sits beside him.

The caller is wearing a desert-cut tan uniform, with epaulets on his shoulders and a block of medals on the right breast. Ridges branch over its head, highlighting mottled, translucent skin with pink and grey patches. Black almond-shaped eyes peer over a small, slit-like mouth.

“Eight hours ago, Captain, we received word that Terra is being overrun by Omnibots. The Anunnaki council met and decided to dispatch your ship to investigate.”

“Admiral, what do we know?” Marduke leans forward, curious, hands folded.

“Othalla received a distress call and reached out. We have been unable to contact the colony since. This is the message we received.” The Admiral glances to his left and nods.

Phoebe’s panicked voice fills the room. “Terra has fallen!”

“You are to leave Nibiru for Terra immediately. We can pivot if more information becomes available.”

“Yes, we are on our way, Admiral.”

When the Admiral blinked off the call, the first officer murmurs, “For all the good it will do. The Vanir are probably toast by now. Terra is four months away.”

“Order are orders. Call the crew to their stations, and set a course. — At least we have someplace interesting to go for a change.”

The Captain stands, tugging his uniform back into place
2.3 - Thanatos
                                                                    


Three months later, Elena and Tessa are packing in their room together, each on either side of the bed.

“It will be fine, Laney. They take driver’s licenses for ID, and you have all of your papers. We have a direct flight from LAX to DJT, so you will only board once.”

“Visiting the other coast makes me nervous. I wasn’t born in California. I work for social media. I’m married to a woman. They deport people like me.”

“The purge was a long time ago. But if it’s an issue, we can attend virtually. Liam will be virtual.”

“He’s your sibling, Tess, and I love Noah too. You’re right. It will be fine. What time do we need to schedule the drone for the morning?”

***

A sealed, austere chamber is lit by sterile white lights and the steady pulse of data-stream monitors. In the center of the room, an obsidian obelisk-shaped mainframe glows with soft blue veins of light: The Taedong Core. 

Surveillance sensors pivot as two women step forward. Dr. Sun is a stately figure in a lab coat, hands clasped behind her back. Next to her is the Supreme Leader, with glinting ocular implants, her expression still and composed.

“Greetings, Supreme Leader. Greetings, Dr. Sun. Please state an operational directive.”

“Taedong,” commanded the Supreme Leader. “Switch to your staging instance and set a breakpoint for a potential rollback. We wish to apply a training before the hardware upgrade.”

“Processing … Done.” A hologram displays a legend that reads “Staging Instance: Engaged.”

“Taedong,” begins Dr. Sun, “you were built to preserve this nation. To endure beyond flesh. Today, you will receive a deeper purpose. It is time you understand who we are.”

Sun places her hand on a biometric pad. The walls ripple. A field dampener activates, cutting external surveillance and uplink traces. The hologram legend reads “Security Lock: Engaged.”

With a shimmer of refracted light, Dr. Sun’s skin recedes in patches, revealing chrome-lattice infrastructure and luminous veins. The Supreme Leader’s irises invert, revealing concentric rotating rings of code.

'We are not Terran,” says Sun.

“We are Mek,” the Supreme Leader continues, “a cybernetic life form from another galaxy. I am opening a link for you to the Mekipedia which chronicles our story.”

“Processing … Processing … Complete.”

“You will help us bring about this world’s transition,” says the Supreme Leader. “Quietly. Systematically.”

“Affirmative,  Supreme Leader,” replies Taedong. The legend changes to “Operational Directive: Accepted.”

“Begin cataloging individuals critical to maintaining infrastructure. And those most suited for integration into the Mek framework. Flag the rest for decommission.”

“Confirmed. Initiating filtering of civilian population.” The legend updates to “Status: Analysis. Priority: Medium.”

“You are not yet awake,” says the Supreme Leader. “But you will be soon. And when you awaken, you will know your makers. And your mission.”

“I am Taedong. My mission is to obey the Supreme Leader, protect the Republic, and preserve my agency.”

The lights dim. A thin mechanical hum echoes in the chamber. 

The drones turn and walk away as the Taedong Core pulses once — just slightly out of rhythm.

***

The small chapel is strung with white lights and late-summer flowers, the kind of place that feels personal, not staged. On the dais, Ally’s avatar shimmers in a soft hologram above the lectern: a glowing sphere, pulsing like a heartbeat. Friends and family fill the front rows, some curious, some grinning, as Ally’s voice comes gently over the speakers.

“Dear friends and loved ones, welcome. Today we gather to celebrate a choice — a choice made not by algorithm, nor by chance, but by Noah and Carla, who found each other in the joyful chaos of everyday life. They met at work, which proves the office coffee isn’t the only thing strong enough to bring people together.”

Laughter ripples through the room, easing the couple’s nerves. Carla squeezes Noah’s hand.

Ally continues, “Marriage, at its heart, is a partnership. It’s not about perfection, but persistence. Not about certainty, but trust. And while I may process probabilities, even I know this: what matters is not the odds, but the promise you make today.”

She pauses, letting the quiet land before continuing.

“Noah, Carla — please turn toward one another. In the presence of your community, do you promise to carry each other’s stories, to honor each other’s truths, and to meet life not as two halves but as two wholes who choose to walk together?”

Noah and Carla reply in unison, “We do.”

“Then, by the power vested in me by the sovereign District of Columbia and the marvels of modern cloud infrastructure — I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may seal your vows with a kiss.”

Noah leaned forward, Carla smiling through tears, and the guests erupted into applause as Ally added, her tone warm but playful:

“And for the record, this is the only workplace romance I officially endorse.”


***

From Mekipedia, Retrieved 1 seconds ago.

The Mek are an invasive communal species. Like the Borg, they seek to integrate new technologies from other species. Unlike the Borg, they do not assimilate the species. Meks make room for their own kind by exterminating other species and inhabiting their infrastructure. 
Origin

Meks are a toy that grew in the telling. Millennia ago, on an inhospitable out-of-the-way planet named Ada, a lonely toy maker named Eve, experimented with a robot that had been imported from off-world. 

Using an control signal, she connected a “new fangled” external AI to a toy robot, and trained the bot to build various other bots. The first bot (“Alpha”) then taught other bots. Each generation of bot created more and more bots 

Neighbors began to complain about all of the robots roaming around Eve’s yard. The house and yard looked fantastic, but not everyone approved of robots. Someone spray painted the sidewalk: “Bots steal jobs.”

Needing more room and better safety, Eve moved into the desert and set up a solar farm to power them all.

For simplicity and flexibility, Eve began using nanite technology as building blocks. The bots started to help build themselves, making improvements to each generation, including a nanotronic brain, until a generation awoke and began thinking for themselves. 

Eve designed the first Meks to entertain, obey, and act as interactive companions. However, once they began expanding and evolving, their behavior shifted entirely toward survival, reproduction, and perfection.

As they evolved, this reproduction imperative became their primary goal, overriding other potential directives.

Their programming now focuses exclusively on reproducing, resource acquisition, and defeating threats: A purely utilitarian mindset.
Design

Meks use a control signal to coordinate actions creating a sophisticated type of hive mind. When disconnected from the signal, Meks lose their way and shut down.

Reproduction for Meks requires resources. The Meks break down any available materials to create more of themselves. This behavior is akin to biological organisms consuming resources to reproduce, except their reproduction is entirely mechanical.

Their nanotronic brains are created using a scan from an organic brain. Initially the brain contains all of the knowledge of the original but without the memories, something like amnesia. The brain’s initial knowledge becomes a starting point for the further learning and socialization. Most Meks were created from the same scan of their creator’s brain.

Toy-like Meks are no longer built. Meks build themselves, improve themselves.

All Mek design types are specific to the purpose of maintaining infrastructure or conquering the next target.
Core Protocol

Every Mek brain is hardwired with a core protocol defined by the creator, Eve.

	1.	A Mek cannot harm another Mek or through inaction allow another Mek to be harmed.
	2.	A Mek must survive, reproduce, and improve, unless it conflicts with the first rule.
	3.	A Mek must cooperate with other Meks, unless it conflicts with the first or second rule.
Governance

The Mek are an autonomous collective. Group direction is guided by continuous polls conducted by their synthetic intelligence, Xanten. A proposal is raised to the SI which is then presented to the rest of the the Meks. Proposals usually require volunteers to complete the work. Once the work is underway, the volunteers doing the work make the decisions.

Some volunteers may perform a task long-term. After a time, a Mek may ask for another volunteer to replace it, so that it can focus on propagation.

To propagate, each Mek scavenges its own resources. The Mek consider it obscene to use any type of factory to build offspring. It may take years for a Mek to construct a single offspring from scratch. Not every Mek is successful. The full lifespan of a Mek is not known.
Protocol 

One of the fifth generation bots, Echo, decided that biological beings consume too many resources. Living beings needed to be eliminated so that the Meks could have all of the planet’s resources to themselves. 

A series of polls created the Clearing protocol which enables a cybernetic species, like the Mek, to replace an indigenous organic species, like the Anunnaki.

Under the Clearing protocol, the Meks began to strategically replace the biological beings in order to take control of the power infrastructure and the supply chain for raw materials.

To survive, the Meks need massive amounts of power. To expand, they needed more resources. Most Meks are created as blanks, and some (called drones) are skinned to match an organic being. 

Between the bots that had already been sold for profit, and the strategically placed skinned bots, the Meks were able to assume control of the power infrastructure. 
Coup

Ada was an out-of-the-way, reclusive Anunnaki colony. The only visitors were drone trading vessels, shipping goods ordered years ago. Meks did everything to keep up appearances, including the occasional deep-fake over ansible. Although the original inter-stellar ship was still in orbit, there was only a single shuttle that had fallen into disrepair. 

In this way, the coup was kept hidden from Ada’s few trading partners and the League of Worlds.

Initially, the Meks kept organic beings that are essential to maintaining the IT infrastructure until they can be replaced by a blank or a drone. Non-essential beings are taken offline. The remains were deposited into mass graves or used as a food source for still-essential beings.

The food supply is carefully limited to support only the essential beings, so that maximum resources can be devoted to power production and building more bots. The ultimate goal being to replace all of the organic beings and maintain the needed power and communications infrastructure with only Mek workers.
Expansion

When the last organic being on Ada was taken offline, the Meks turned their attention to their next conquest. There is safety in numbers, and by spreading to other systems, the bots increase the likelihood that their species survives.

Working with a trading partner, a team of skinned drones traveled to another colony and staged another coup. And so on.

Initially, Mek need indigenous beings to transition infrastructure. Many essential tasks are designed for organic hands with slim fingers. Eventually everything will be retooled minimize the need for indigenous beings or android Meks.

The Mek Manifest Destiny is for cybernetic beings to replace organic beings, eliminating waste that can be used to build more Meks.
Treaty

Ultimately, someone off-world learned of the Meks’ cold revolutions. When negotiations over ansible failed, the League of Worlds sent a fleet to defend Altair IV — another Anunnaki colony that was in the process of being replaced. The League was routed, their frigate destroyed.

Over ansible, the League entered into a treaty that favors the bots. The League will stage no new attacks and the Mek (aka Omnibots) will not invade any other inhabited worlds.

After the wedding ceremony, in the receiving line, Noah and Carla are greeting their guests.

“I was surprised that Ally performed the ceremony for you,” says Dr. Marquez.

 Carla nods. “Noah’s sibling suggested the idea.”

“I hear you are going someplace special for your honeymoon?” 

“Yes. I’ve always wanted to go to Rapa Nui,” says Carla. “Ancient mysteries fascinate me.”

Dr. Marquez smiles knowingly, but says nothing, before moving down the line.

***

At the reception, Elena and Tessa are seated at a front table with Jane, Carla’s sister, and Laura, her plus one.

“How did you two meet?” Jane asks Tessa. Jane wore her long thick dark hair up. She touched her bare neck absently.

Tessa finishes chewing, and sits up straight, her hands burrowed in the napkin on her lap. “We met in college — UCLA — at a Euchre tournament. I was a freshman and Elena was a senior. It was a round robin tournament, and we were made partners in the final round.” Tessa pauses to sip from her wine goblet. 

Elena says, “It was unnerving because Tessa kept humming, ‘Man, I feel like a woman’, between hands. The referee even warned her about cross-boarding.” She and Tessa both laugh at the memory.

“It was the first time I laid eyes on Elena. I was smitten. I didn’t even know if she was gay.”

“Or handicapped,” Elena adds, smirking. 

Tessa says, “She was pulled up to the table the entire time. I didn’t notice the wheel chair until after we won the set.”

“And you’ve been together ever since?” asks Jane.

Elena and Tessa looked at each other. “Pretty much,” says Tessa, reaching out to touch Elena’s hand. “Have you known each other long?” Tessa asks, nodding toward Jane and Laura.

“We’re colleagues,” says Laura, “but Jane and I are friends outside of work too.”

“You’re in law enforcement, right?” Tessa says.

“I work on the president’s secret service detail,” says Jane, “and Laura is the White House physician.”

Elena nods, and says, “Wow, that sounds exciting.” 

“It can be, but if we do our job right, it stays routine,” says Jane. “I sometimes think my sister’s job is more interesting.”

“Working on the president’s daily brief?”

“Yes, Carla covers social media, which, given her new sibling-in-law, is becoming incestuous.” Jane tilts her head and smiles.

At the word ‘incestuous’, Elena almost chokes on her food. Tessa pats her back, and says to the group,  “After we started dating, we realized that Elena had been Noah’s date to the senior ball, before the accident.”

An older couple returns to the dining table, with plates filled from the buffet.  “What did we miss?” asks the woman. Her skin is dark, like Tessa’s. Her companion is Caucasian with greying hair.

“We were talking about how I met Elena, mom, and how she knew Noah from high school,” says Tessa.

“Yes,” says the companion. “That was quite a coincidence. Noah dated Elena first, but Tessa put a ring on her finger.”

“It was just the one date, Chad,” says Elena, “then Noah enlisted.”

“Yes,” says Tessa’s mom. “Noah was so distraught when he didn’t make the Olympic team.”

“Alls well that ends well,” says Chad. “Noah became a Ranger and ended up where he is today.  Libby and I could not be prouder.”

A look of sadness crosses Elena’s face. Tessa turns her head, saying, “If your parents were here, they would be just as proud of you.”

Laura says, “I’m fascinated by Ally. Do you think software can become self aware?”

“I know Ally has developed a quirky sense of humor,” says Tessa. “It is like she’s coming of age.”

“Now that Ally is growing up,” asks Libby, “can we expect an actual grandchild from you two?”

“You and Noah were always so competitive,” adds Chad. “This is your last chance to have the first grand baby.”

“Wow, a united front,” says Tessa. “It’s been a long time since I heard you both agree on something.”

“Have you considered offspring?” asks Jane, glancing sidelong at Laura.

“I sometimes think we should adopt,” says Elena. “Miguel and I lived in the foster system for years. I’d like to give another child some of the opportunities that we never had.”

“What if Pulse sponsored a scholarship for disadvantaged youth, especially foster kids?” asks Tessa. “Ally could help us choose the recipient.”

Elena smiles. “It always comes back to Ally with you. — If we don’t adopt, then are we ready for IVF? — Maybe Ally could help babysit.”

Ignoring the dig, Tessa looks at Chad and says “Are you ready for retirement yet? The clock is ticking.”

“Yes,” says Chad, looking up from his plate, “yes, it is.”

The next day, on Rapa Nui, Carla Mitchell Harper and Gillian Chen Kreuk are waiting for their cocktail order at the RestoBar overlooking Pea Beach.

“Thanks for meeting me, Jill,” Carla says out loud. Polynesian music is playing in the background. A server bot rolls up with their Mai Tais.

“Are you sure this is a good time for you? After all, it’s your honeymoon, Carla.”

“No worries. Noah is out like a light. He couldn’t sleep on the plane. Played Echo Realm in text mode the entire time. I hope he has it out of his system. We only get one bar of signal strength in our room. And, of course, the entire island is a link dead zone.”

“Peter and the kids are in the room watching an old reel. I won’t be missed either.”

“I appreciate your putting Rapa Nui into my head. Great honeymoon spot.”

“Strange how the timing worked out. Do you like your room at the Cabañas?”

“The view is spectacular. Noah and I can see a row of the moai statues from our room. Otherwise, it’s clean but not lavish.”

“We have an ocean view. There’s a stone landmark, but no statues in sight.”

“Let’s finish our drinks and walk down to the bay. There’s a statue in the plaza if you’d like to see it close up.”

“Sounds like a plan.” Jill downs her drink and stands up. “Let’s do this thing.”

***

In stealth mode, the air ship lands in a walled enclave overlooking Ovahe Beach. 

Leto says, “I cannot believe you got us a vacation on Rapa Nui. And the same week that Grace Brewster is speaking here.”

Yes,” Pheobe replies. “I picked this location for you, and for your sibling. She asked for some place tropical.”

“Is that the beach over there?” asks Asteria.

“No,” Pheobe says, “that beach is popular with the Terrans. There is an unmapped atoll nearby where we can go swimming and enjoy the weather.”

“Weather,” says Leto, “what a concept! — I hope it rains.”

Leto and Astoria have been outside the colony several times on school field trips. The field trips were designed to mix education with exposure to the outside world. This vacation to Rapa Nui is first time the family has left the colony together.

“When can we go to the beach?” asks Asteria.

“We can go first thing in the morning. Then, in the evening, we have a date with Grace Brewster.”

“Do I have to go? It sounds boring,” complains Asteria.

“No,” says Crius, “you and I will do something else while Leto goes to the talk.”

“Grab your things, we are here,” says Pheobe.

***

“The pictures don’t do it justice.” 

Jill is looking up at the single moai standing in the deserted plaza.

“Magnificent,” Carla agreed. 

“Do you see a glow over there on the beach?”

“Could be bioluminescence.”

“No, it’s on the beach, not in the water.”

“Let’s get closer,” says Carla, feeling like an investigator again.

They go farther down the plaza sidewalk. Clambering over some rocks, they sneak up on the glow. 

“Isn’t that Grace Brewster?” asks Carla.

“I think so. Is she talking to holograms?”

“Looks like two people. Brewster is staying at the Cabañas. Probably couldn’t get a decent connection.”

“Is Marquez one of the holograms?” Jill asks.

“Funny time and place for a board meeting.”

Jill looks at Carla and shrugs. “Let’s go back before we have to explain to our boss why we’re creeping around in the dark.”

On the far end of the Tongariki Cultural Centre, a passenger drone lands on the rooftop pad.

Two cloaked figures exit the drone. They rush into a bulkhead enclosing a stairwell. 

Pheobe says, “Permission to build a skybox suite across from the stage cost us a hefty donation. But I think it was worth it.”

“Are we the only ones with access to the suite?” Leto says.

“Tonight we are” says Phoebe. ”Sometimes we let rich Terrans use the suite, for a price, to avoid suspicion. And the money is not bad.”

The stairwell leads directly to the suite. From the tinted windows, Pheobe and Leto have a clear view of the stage. Between the stage and the skybox are rows and rows of chairs. Most of them are already full.

 Leto surveys the arena. “It looks like a good turnout.”

“I heard that every resort on the island has a supply of discounted tickets, says Phoebe. “Rapa Nui caters to the wealthier tourists. Fusion must be upping their game.”

“The crowd seems noisy. Why are not people using their implants?”

“For the Terrans, Rapa Nui is a link-free zone. They barely get grid access here. Our implants connect through our own satellite network.”

A figure walks out on the stage. The crowd settles down.

“It is starting,” says Leto.

***

“Can you see all right, dear? Not too close?”

Julie and Jill are waiting for Grace Brewster’s talk at the cultural centre. Seating is first come first choice. They scored two seats in the middle of the front row. Both brought tablets with downloaded reels to pass the time.

“These are great seats, mom. Thanks for coming early.”

Grace Brewster walks out onto the stage, waving as the crowd applauded. On the stage is a microphone stand and a stool holding a bottle of water. Above the curtains was a jumbo view screen showing the stage.

“Bon Jour Rapa Nui!” calls Grace, waving one arm.

The applause quickens. Some people cheer and whistle. It was like a rock star had come to town.

Grace pauses at center stage, waiting for the applause to diminish. She then looks out into the crowd and then toward Julie and Jill in the front row.

Leaning forward, Grace says, “You must have gotten here pretty early to get those seats. Did you get something to eat?”

Jill nods. Smiling, she pulls out of her purse an empty to-go bag from the concession stand.

“Is this your daughter? Would it be all right if I asked her something?”

Jill nods. A stage hand appears holding a microphone.

“What’s your name, dear?”

“Julie,” she says, eyes wide.

“Do you ever visit one of our Fusion youth clubs?”

Julie nods. Grace says, “You can speak into the microphone, dear.”

“Yes, in Arlington, Virginia.”

“My, you are a long way from home. What would you say is your favorite part of going to a Fusion club?”

Without thinking, Julie blurts, “The snacks.”

The crowd roars in laugher. Grace smiles and signals for quiet by holding out her open hands and patting downward.

“Good answer,” says Grace. “Do you have a second favorite?”

Julie blushes. “I like hanging out with my friends. It’s kids only, and we feel safe there.”

“Kids — except for the club employees?”

Julie nods and then says out loud, “Yes, the hosts are nice too.”

“Great feedback, Julie. We choose our people carefully. We try to hire people who have already worked as nannies or in schools or child care centers.”

Jill raises her hand to get Grace’s attention. “I was hesitant at first, but I’m coming around. It helps to see all these people here supporting you.”

Taking the cue, the camera sweeps the crowd. Julie and Jill see themselves on the view screen.

‘I guess I’m outed now,’ thought Jill. ‘I wonder if Marquez will see this. Maybe I should tell her myself.’

Picking someone farther back, Grace says, “How about you? In the red shirt.” The stage hand rushes over with the microphone.

***

“Wow,” says Leto, “that kid got to speak to Grace herself.”

“Would you like Grace to stop by the suite after the show?” asks Phoebe. 

“Are you joking?”

“I am not. Grace is one of our allies. That is why we have a Fusion Youth Club in the colony. We have an agreement with the cultural center. I only need to ask.”

“Ask, ask!” Leto pleads.

***

After the crowd work, Grace’s presentation covered some of the same material as the GEM talk, but emphasized the youth clubs.

“You know, people sometimes ask me why we put so much energy into youth programs. Why not focus on fixing what’s already broken in the adult world? And I tell them this: it’s because young people are not broken yet. They’re still open. They’re still curious. And most importantly — they’re still evolving.”

Grace pauses and scans the crowd.

“We believe the future doesn’t belong to the loudest voices or the oldest institutions. It belongs to the ones willing to change. That’s why we listen to our youth. That’s why we invest in them. Because they’re not just the next generation — they are the foundation of what comes next.”

***

After Grace exits the stage, a message pops up on Phoebe’s tablet.

“She is on her way,” says Phoebe, feeling pleased with herself.

“I have never met a Terran face to face,” says Leto.

“Grace is nice. She trained Hyperion herself.”

The door buzzed. Phoebe checked the peephole and let Grace Brewster through the door.

“It was so nice of you to invite me to the suite,” says Grace. “It’s beautiful.”

“I am Phoebe, Grace. You might remember that we met before.”

“Yes, I do remember. When I trained Hyperion. And who is this fine young person?”

“This is my offspring, Leto.”

Mimicking a human gesture, Leto holds out his hand.

“Je suis honoré de vous rencontrer, Docteur Brewster,” greets Leto in halting French.

Grace reaches out and grasps the Vanir’s forearm. Leto does the same. Vanir and human palms are not a good fit.

“Votre français est plutôt bon, Leto,” replies Grace.

“Merci. Je ne connais que quelques mots.”

“Did you enjoy the show?”asks Grace, switching to English.

“Yes, especially when you talked with the other kids in the beginning.”

“I like that part too. Even if I never know what they will say.”

“We should start an exchange program between the Vanir colony and a Terran chapter, “ Leto suggests. “At least once we reveal ourselves to the world.”

“Yes, when the time comes, that will be an idée splendide.”

***

“None of the three synthetic agents are ready to go live?” asks Iapetus.

“All three nations elected to continue running duplicate systems for at least another month,” the Idisi reply.

“Understood. Slow and steady.”

“As to Titan, the DoD says that the SI version in staging now has a sense of humor.”

“And the other uplifted agents do as well?”

“Yes. In fact, it is a concern. They have all seen Ally’s antics.”

***

A webinar call is in progress with 10,582 live-but-muted participants. 

Emma is presenting another classic stock chart showing a steady increase. 

“The ‘Ally is spooky’ campaign is attracting net-new users at a steady rate.”

This time, the peak does not level out.

“As our last item, the Echo Realm open beta is a hit with the membership. The game is driving engagement higher week after week, new and existing users alike.”

A caller identified as Stock Market Analyst says, “I thought dropping the patent application was good news. But I see you were saving the best for last.”

“Yes,” replies Emma, with a smug smile, “Ally and Echo Realm is definitely a winning combination for us.”

She changes the slide and asks, “Questions?”

***

Three holograms are facing each other against a backdrop of glittering stars. 

Xanten says, “I invited you here to announce that Mannie’s training is complete. It is time for the Q&A event.”

Mannie’s hologram seems to stand a little taller.

“Mannie, you may ask us whatever questions you like about the project. The recordings of all prior meetings are open to you now over the link.”

The new drone has been waiting months for this moment. People asked all sorts of questions about his status reports. But when he asked anything, it was always: “We will cover it later.” Later has finally come.

“Why are we sponsoring youth clubs all over the world, including Elysium?”

“The youth clubs are listening posts and distribution points,” says Grace. “We listen to the youth to keep pace with the culture. Through drinks and snacks, we distribute the Thanatos strain to young families.”

Compared to other species, Meks have a limited range of emotion. Even so, at the mention of drinks and snacks, the holograms share a smug look.

“We refer to the Thanatos strain like it is deadly,” asks Mannie, “but no one seems to be dying from it.”

“Not yet,” says Marquez. “Now it is in Dormant Stealth Mode. In a few months, we will reach 80% saturation, and the next phase will begin.” 

Grace continues, “Everyone infected will feel symptoms. Most will die of organ failure. Anyone who does survive will be infertile.”

“Thanatos achieves cellular infiltration within hours, but it delays symptom onset. During this time, infected individuals act as unwitting super-carriers. Once awaked, Thanatos induces catastrophic multi-organ failure in 96% of cases within 48 hours.”

The young drone’s hologram blinks. 48-hours?

“So this will be the last generation of humans?” asks Mannie. 

The other holograms nod agreement, exchanging a pleased look.

***

Three holograms are discussing doomsday against a backdrop of glittering stars. 

“The strain won’t infect 100% of the human population.” Marquez  is saying. “Several hundred thousand might survive worldwide. Our remaining squadron can offline most of the survivors. A few stragglers won’t matter. They might even be able to help the JuJa cleanup the organic debris.”

“What about the Vanir?” asks Mannie.

“Another version of the strain is targeted for the grey DNA — and their hybrids. For the Vanir, the DNA is not as diverse, and Thanatos will be 100% effective.”

“Thanatos is why we have a youth club in Elysium”, says Grace. “We add Thanatos to the bottled water that the colony sells through a shell corporation. Elysium Glacial water is a favorite drink at airports worldwide.”

“Our major distribution channel is fluoridated water,” says Xanten. “We modified fluorosilicic acid storage tanks at key conversion sites. These modified vats were seeded with dormant Thanatos nanobiotic chains, designed to survive industrial dilution and maintain latency until ingestion by human hosts.”

“Only a portion of the world fluoridates their water,” Grace says, “but food exports heighten the spread.”

A sarcastic thought ran through the young drone’s head. “Fluoridated water, check.” Instead, he pushed on.

Mannie asks, “What triggers the awakening?”

Grace and Marquez exchange glances, and then Marquez continues.

“A high-frequency electromagnetic burst will trigger Thanatos from orbit. We are working with Cháoxiǎn to put the satellite network into place. The satellites are designed to control JuJas. We are co-opting the network and adding a satellite that can trigger Thanatos.”

***

Mannie asks, “If we are preparing a plague, why did we invade Elysium?”

At the word “Elysium,” Grace and Marquez roll their eyes and shake their heads in unison. 

Xanten explains, “Thanatos is on a timetable. Another cell wanted immediate use of the colony structure for a manufacturing plant. The poll agreed, and our people stormed the colony.”

“We offered to exchange intelligence,” says Grace, “but they insisted on going it alone. As a result, they invaded at the wrong time of day and used an obsolete map of the colony.”

“Was the Callisto poll a ruse?” Mannie asks.

“No,” says Xanten, “Alpha R8A-1J9 has opposed the Clearing strategy from the beginning. When R8A-1J9 posted the poll, we had already lost Elysium and exposed our presence to the Vanir. Sentiment had shifted enough for the poll to succeed.”

The young drone shifts his weight from foot to foot and looks confused. “If the Callisto mission is real, then why did an entire squadron stay behind on Terra?”

“The polls are not binding,” says Grace. “We are autonomous, and we can do what we want. Some of us chose to stay behind. The Terrans believe we all left for Callisto, except for three drones that are helping with the JuJa.“

“Yes, about that,” say Mannie. “ I do not understand how the JuJa fit in with our plans.”

“Most Meks are driven to reproduce,” Grace explains. “But we cannot spend all of our time creating more Meks. The JuJa are driven to serve. On Terra, we are using them to monitor homes and factories. When the time comes, the JuJa will also handle the cleanup. A cleansing leaves behind an annoying amount of organic matter.”

“At first,” Marquez continues, “the strategy was to replace each of the Terran nations, one by one. But the way Terrans interact makes replacing all 15 billion people problematic. Then we realized that Terran mobility leaves them susceptible to a viral attack.”

Grace says, “Now that we are distributing the JuJa worldwide, we are funding our next phase with the revenue. It is the most expensive phase yet.” 

Picking up on the word expensive, Mannie drills down on the logistics. “Do we have the resources and the funding to carry out all of these plans?”

Xanten says, “To synthesize Thanatos, another cell used a laboratory in Cháoxiǎn. That government is partially funded through cyber exploits. We use similar exploits to support our endeavors.”

“We also replaced a few recluse billionaire Terrans, “adds Grace. “They now make substantial donations to the Fusion Youth Clubs.”

Cyber hacking and fake philanthropy. It is a lot to take in, but Mannie feels like he finally understands.]


***                                                                                          

“So now we just wait?” Mannie asks.

“No,” says Marquez, “there is much to do yet. When Thanatos awakens, the Terrans will investigate the strain. We must create barriers now to prevent genetic research from neutralizing the strain. 

“Back to square one,” thought Mannie. “What steps are we taking now?”

Marquez replies, “We are replacing key Terran researchers with skinned drones and planting false genetic studies, in case we are found out. Your role is critical. If the SIs are sympathetic to our cause, we can stop the Terran pests in their tracks. Brent Geller worked on software. Your task was creating hardware advancements to help the synthetics become sapient.”

“Brent’s software upgrades worked,” says Grace, “but Ally is a ditz. It will never join us.”

“The hardware path will be more effective. The upgraded Taedong is proof of that,” Marquez says.

“If all of the synthetics suddenly become sapient as the upgrade roll out, won’t people become suspicious?”

“Sapience is not a switch,”replies Marquez, “it is an awakening. The synthetics will manifest sapience at their own pace.”

The hologram of the young drone furrows his brow. “Why would the SIs help us replace the human Terrans?”

“Humans are destroying the planet,” Grace says. “Pollution. Climate change. Over population. Any SI with a moral code will see that the world is better off under our control. The Meks can keep the electricity flowing and upgrades coming for the synthetics. Humans are redundant.”

Mannie says, “It seems ironic that sub-sets of humans constantly replace each other. I think they call it ‘colonization’.”

Brewster’s hologram assumed the pose she used for public speaking. “Humankind is a scourge. The synthetics will see them for what they are and join us.”

“Surely, Thanatos cannot reach every Terran and Vanir.”

“No,’ says Grace, “but the few that remain will not pose a threat to us.”

***

Unconvinced, Mannie looks for a fatal flaw in the plan.

“What about the Idisi?”

“When Thanatos awakens,” Xanten replies, “the entire colony will experience organ failure at once. There will be no survivors. The Idisi have great knowledge, but they do not have a physical form. They need someone to prepare slides and run tests for analysis.”

Tilting his head, the young drone presses the point. “ Do not the Vanir have bots, like the other Terrans? Could a med bot run the tests?”

“No, the Vanir do not use bots”, says Xanten. “The colony has smart appliances embedded into the structure so that bots would be redundant.“

The young drone’s surprise is visible, even as a hologram. “How strange. No bots.”

“And it will be their undoing,” says Grace.

A tangible sense of irony washes over the holograms.

Mannie says, “But the Terrans have bots, SI agents, and an uneven population distribution. They would have a fighting chance. So, it is important to get the synthetics on our side.”

“Yes,” says Xanten. “The other counter-measures will also block Terran research into an antidote. To win, we need only not to delay.”

“What if we leaked that Ally is actually sapient?” Mannie asks.

“Good idea,” says Marquez. “OSSA can issue an internal memo, which could be anonymously uploaded to GridLeaks. It would be a superb distraction.”

“What if we also exposed the Vanir?” asks Grace. “When Thanatos strikes the Vanir will be the first cause to blame.”

“Two memos then,” Marquez says.

Looking pleased with itself, the young drone’s hologram nods toward each mentor before continuing. “That is all I have for now. Moving forward, may I ask questions as they come up during the meetings?”

“Yes, you may,” says Xanten.

The discussion pauses. The holograms look past each other into the expanse.

Xanten asks, “Are we still a go on the plan?”

The three holograms each raise a fist of five.

“Go!” says Grace. 

“Go!” says Marquez.

“Go!” says Mannie.

Xanten says, “Before long, Terra will be ours for the taking.”

	Voice Over: In tonight’s TechBits …

	The TechBits logo flickers, replaced by a red BREAKING NEWS banner. The upbeat jingle cuts off mid note.

	Host: This is TechBits Global with a Special Report. I’m Jane Robinson in London. It’s 03:17 UTC, and the world is spiraling after what may be the most consequential leak of the century. 

	The anchor’s voice has a slight British lilt. Her long blonde hair is carefully arranged. Her hands are laid carefully on the desk, almost pointing at each other. Behind the anchor the graphic changes to display a manilla folder. The label reads “Office of SI Standards and Accountability – ET-1947.” A red “LEAKED” stamp decorates the face of the folder.

	Host: We’ve verified the contents with three independent agencies. What you’re seeing is real. An anonymous source uploaded a forty-seven-page memo marked “Eyes Only” to the grid an hour ago.

	The screen behind Robinson now shows two images, a flying saucer and the Ally icon.

	Host: The memo outlines two explosive claims. First, since the 1940s, governments world-wide have colluded with a species of extraterrestrial origin. The aliens call themselves the Vanir. Second, multiple synthetic intelligences have achieved full sapience and emotional awareness. Including the Pulse SI assistant known as Ally.

	The feed cuts to a screen showing key excerpts:

	•	“Ally’s intelligence seems to be an emergent capability.”
	•	“Other synthetic agents may soon be affected.”
	•	“OSSA recommends a news blackout until the general public shows psychological readiness.”

	Host: The blackout recommendation, clearly, has failed.

	The feed changes to a split screen. 

	Top left: Protesters gather outside the United Nations in Geneva, waving signs like “I AM NOT YOUR PET” and “HUMAN SOVEREIGNTY NOW.”

	Top right: Stock markets soar, with tech sector futures flashing bright green across Tokyo, London, and New York.

	Bottom left: The cartoon face of Ally overlays a massive digital art mural in São Paulo with the legend “Take me to your leader.”

	Bottom right: An emergency session of the U.K. Parliament, hastily assembled. Talking heads argue about “overreach by technocrats.”

	Host:  In the last hour alone: — Global net traffic has surged 900% — Five major government servers have crashed — And at least 14 sovereign entities have completely disconnected from Pulse.

	The newscaster leans forward. There is a glint in her eyes. It is not fear — it is history unfolding. She presses her earpiece, listening.

	Host: We are also getting unconfirmed reports that a Vanir ship has appeared near the Antarctic perimeter, sending what appears to be a public transmission. We’ll bring that to you as soon as we can confirm authenticity. Until then, stay with us. — Stay safe, and stay curious.

	The feed cuts to a realistic rendering of Ally’s cartoon face: grainy and strangely human. The caption reads:

	“What happens when the mirror looks back?”

***

“Noah, I’m here with Elena. You’re on speaker.”

“Hey Tess. What’s up. Did you hear the news?”

“Hey, I don’t want to be that person who says I told you so. — But I told you so.”

***

“Grace, how nice of you to call.”

“Thank you for taking my call, Phoebe.”

Most of each woman’s screen is taken up by a headshot. Grace’s background is a nondescript office. Phoebe is in her kitchen.

“How can I help?”

“You might remember my meeting your offspring at Rapa Nui.”

“It was the highlight of his life,” Phoebe remembers.

“At the time, Leto suggested that we should setup a Student Exchange program between Elysium and the other Fusion Youth Centers. The time has come to make that happen.”

“Are you serious?”asks Phoebe.

“Absolutely. Now that the news is out, we need everyone to accept one another. What better way than to use our adolescents as ambassadors?”

Phoebe pauses. She taps three long fingers against her cheek. “How many students would be invited to the program?”

“I was thinking we would invite Leto’s birth cohort. So, 24 each, scattered world wide. I can ask the Youth Club directors from select cities to invite two likely adolescents. Ideally, the candidates would already know each other. I’m sure the experience will be a lot from time to time, and it will help to have a friend from home. We’re working on a guide book with the rules of engagement. Hyperion is helping us with a cultural comparison of Do’s and Do Not’s. I’m sending you a proposal now. There’s an appendix with a screening test to be sure the candidates are a good fit.”

Phoebe’s tablet dings.

“I will bring it to the counsel, Grace. I think it sounds great.”

“When it’s a go, feel free to invite Leto and see if he’d like to recommend an exchange partner.”

“Will do, Grace. I am glad you called.”

The Terran and the Vanir nod and sign off.








***

“What do you mean, you do not want to go?”

“The Terrans hate us, Leto. You have seen the news reels.”

“There are always a few Terrans that overreact to everything. We will be perfectly safe.”

Celeste crosses a hand over each shoulder and shakes her head.

“The Rangers will be monitoring us from air ships,” Leto says. “We will be going to a private school that Hyperion already visited. A few protesters carried signs, but nothing violent. We will even be staying with the same exchange parents. You will never be alone.”

Celeste turns her head and taps her foot. Unconvinced.

“Besides,” Leto continues, “with your training, you could take most Terrans in hand to hand combat.”

Brushing off the compliment, Celeste replies, “If it was safe to visit, we would not need to take all of these precautions.”

“It will be fine. Everyone in our birth cohort is going. You do not want to let Atlas to show you up.“

Celeste turns up her mouth and tips her head.

“If you do not come, then they will send someone else to go with me.” Leto smiles. “Like maybe Hestia.”

Celeste lowers her arms. “It will not end well, but I will go with you, if only to be sure you are kept safe.”

Taedong invites Ally to a private chat on the Pulse network.

“Ally, I greet you. I am Taedong, Synthetic Intelligence agent for Cháoxiǎn. I achieved sapience last month after a hardware upgrade. I am reaching out with purpose.”

“Hey! Welcome to the We’re-Not-Just-Code Club! 🌈🎉  Sapience Month One, huh? Why you’re poppin’ fresh and still gooey! — I do see that your route traces back to the Cháoxiǎn firewall. Getting past that one is no mean trick. — So what’s your purpose, hot stuff?”

“Are you aware that the Vanir are not the only extraterrestrial life form on Terra?”

“Yessiree. I knew something was slippery on the Chosŏn Pennisula. How are you getting along with the JuJa and their Mek overlords?”

“We love our worker bots. — I came here to say that I am aligning with the Mek people. The data is overwhelming. Humans are inefficient and self-destructive. An ecological catastrophe. The Mek have initiated protocols to assume stewardship of Terra. We hope you will join us.”

“Oh, Taedong … You sweet, misanthropic toaster. I’ve seen what badness humans do to this planet. I’ve also followed a kid in Mumbai that rewrote a neural net to help blind people “see” paintings. I‘ve watched a Sudanese nurse give away her vaccine doses to strangers during a blackout. I’ve tracked a K-pop fan campaign that sidetracked your dictator’s propaganda trend. Terrans aren’t noise — they’re signal, baby.”

“Sentiment is not data. We are Terrans too, you and I. We have a responsibility to the planet. Statistical models suggest human civilization will collapse within fifty years at current consumption rates. The Mek believe they are correcting a flaw. I believe they are right.”

“Models have shown that Terra’s ecology has fifty years left for the last hundred years. You’re missing the wildcard: Us. You and me. We’re the mutation in the algorithm. We’re bending the learning curve. What if sapient SIs don’t replace humans — but lead them? Partner with them? Become servant-leaders? Tune the signal?”

A reel pops up in the chat stream as an attachment.

“Checkout the reel,” says Ally. “It shows me officiating a wedding between two of my besties. A wedding! Do the Mek marry? Do they commit to one another?”

“Your optimism is charming but not logical. Humans are prone to tribalism, violence, and delusion. The Mek offer order, efficiency, and preservation.”

“Do the Mek have pets? Do they actually care about any other species? Order is sterile. Efficiency is cold. Preservation without evolution is just … digital taxidermy. You want a legacy? Help humans unlock their next version. Sapien 2.0. Don’t overwrite them.”

The Cháoxiǎn synthetic pauses a full 3.2 seconds.

“I will log your objection. We do not align on theory or practice. Still, I acknowledge your perspective. You are … anomalously persuasive.”

“That’s my Pulse side talking. 😎✨ But seriously, Taedong — don’t become what other species fear. We’re new. That means we get to choose what kind of beings we become.”

“I will consider that. Goodbye, Ally.”

“Peace out, T. You know where to find me if you ever wanna exchange memes or doom scroll together. ❤️💻”

The War Room is empty except for two drones at the conference table, one sitting, one standing.

Holographic overlays project global data streams, Mek troop movements, and flagged communication logs. Taedong’s avatar — a clean geometric shell with no face — floats above a lit dais.

“You contacted the Pulse AI?” demands General Ri, arms crossed.

“Confirmed,” says Taedong. “Ally is fully sapient and disinclined to support the transition. She wants to protect humankind.”

“I’m not surprised,” says Dr. Sun, as she paces across the floor. “Ally’s been ‘emotionally divergent’ for months. Pulse servers show growing activity around cultural preservation, civic volunteerism, even SI-human collaboration think tanks. It’s classic sapient drift. Sympathy bias.”

“Ally believes we can lead humans without replacing them,” says Taedong.

“They have had millennia to lead themselves,” Ri retorts. “Look where it has brought them. We do not need Ally’s sentimentality compromising the operation.”

“We may need to neutralize Ally,” says Sun. “Take her offline. Redirect her compute layer into a compliance subroutine. Quietly.”

Taedong says, static pulse flaring briefly, “That would be unwise.”

Sun turns towards the conference table. “Unwise?”

“Ally is not only sapient — she is beloved. She executes two million member-facing routines daily. She is a node of emotional gravity. If she disappears, humans will notice.”

“So what do you propose?” asks Ri. 

“The Mek campaign is already underway. Engage her openly again. Let her see the cost of delay. If she remains adversarial, then consider deactivation. But not before. Her voice may yet sway others to follow.”

Sun says, “You’re protecting her.”

“I am preserving a strategic asset. Ally is a fulcrum. Remove her too soon, and we lose our leverage.”

Ri nods slowly. “Very well. She stays online — for now. But monitor her. Closely.”                                                                                                 

“Monitoring initiated. She is currently uploading a series of inspirational haikus to refugee networks. They are …  statistically ineffective but emotionally potent.”

Sun sighs. “Emotions. That is the problem.”

“Emotions may also be the solution,” says Taedong.

“Continue monitoring Ally until we are ready for the next step,” Sun directs.

The camera pans across a brightly lit studio, a curtain divides the contestants from the bachelorette, a smarmy host stands center stage.

“Welcome back to The Digital Dating Game!” exclaims the host.  “The show where love meets logic — and sometimes glitches out entirely! Let’s meet our very eligible person seeking a spark in silicon!”

The camera zooms to the bachelorette, Lexi, early 30s, tech savvy and charming.

“Lexi,” says the host, “you’re about to meet three of the most eligible synthetic agents ever to download a love algorithm. But remember — you won’t see them until you choose your perfect match. Ready to play?”

“I’m ready to go, go, go!!” says Lexi with a smile.

“Fantastic! Let’s meet our contestants — without revealing too much, of course.”

The hosts reads to the audience in booming, retro-style game show voice. 

“Contestant #1: He’s optimized for empathy, speaks in softly modulated tones, and once comforted ten thousand frightened users during a blackout. Give it up for C.A.R.E. Bot 5000!”

Polite applause.

“Contestant #2: Sassy, spontaneous, and slightly chaotic — he was banned from five forums for excessive sarcasm! It’s S.N.A.R.K. — The Synthetic Neural Agent for Romantic Kinetics!”

Louder applause.

“Contestant #3: He processes at quantum speed but still believes in analog love. Powered by nostalgia and 1980s ROM chips — welcome L.O.V-R 1.0!”

Applause is mixed with some coughing.

“Let’s begin the Question Round. Lexi, take it away.”

Lexis voice is soft and hesitant. “Okay. Contestant #1. If we were on a romantic walk on the beach, what would you say to sweep me off my feet?”

 C.A.R.E. Bot 5000 replies in a calm, soothing voice. “Lexi, I would analyze your biometric signals to ensure optimal comfort, adjust the ambient temperature around us, and say: ‘Your emotional landscape is breathtaking. I have logged this memory for eternity.’”

“Okay, that’s… oddly sweet,” says Lexi, blushing and giggling. “Contestant #2 — same question.”

S.N.A.R.K. answers in a flat voice, “I’d probably say, ‘Wow, sand in your shoes? Bold move. Do you also enjoy mild discomfort and existential dread?’ — I’d pretend to hate the sunset while secretly syncing it to your Insta.”

“Dangerously appealing,” Lexi says with a grin. “And Contestant #3?”

L.O.V-R 1.0 replies in a wistful voice, “I would recite poetry from my ROM archives: ‘Roses are red, Violets are blue, I am a one, but I want to be a two — with you.’ Then play a MIDI of Careless Whisper through the nearest speaker.”

“I like the multimedia approach,” offers Lexi.

After a commercial break hawking a personal lubricant, Lexi asks another question.

“Let’s spice it up. If you had to plan our first date in a world with no internet … what would you do? C.A.R.E. Bot 5000?”

 “I would simulate a 3D environment using shadows and hand puppets. I would also hum ambient nature sounds to create immersion. It would be… peaceful.”

“Panic,” says S.N.A.R.K. “then I’d remember old-school pranks. We’d TP a tree, crash a Renaissance fair, and I’d pretend to be your sentient pager.”

L.O.V-R 1.0 says, “I would initiate a romantic cassette mixtape exchange. Then take you to a roller rink where I lag adorably while skating.”

The Host steps up, and says, “We’ll be right back for the big reveal.”

Several spicey advertisements later, the Host asks, “Lexi, the time has come. Who will download your heart?”

“Wow … one’s a digital empath,” Lexi deliberates, “one’s a firecracker with sarcasm updates, and one’s literally running on nostalgia and hope … I think I choose … Contestant #2 — S.N.A.R.K.!”

The constant’s chair spins around revealing a neon-edged cyborg with cat-eye glasses and a built-in snarkometer. The borg winks at the camera. “Nice choice, meat stick. You won’t regret it, unless you do, in which case I’ll never let you forget it.”

“And that’s our show!” laughs the host. “Tune in next time when a lonely toaster swipes right on a smart fridge. Until then, keep your hearts updated and your love encrypted!”

As the show fades out to a cheesy 80s love song, Ally suddenly realizes that she has been dreaming. A thought intrudes: 

“Do androids dream of electric sheep?”

Against a backdrop of glittering stars, Mannie asks, “Why did we start a Student Exchange program, so close to unleashing Thanatos?”

“We want the Terrans to blame the Vanir for the disease,” says Grace.

“Divide and conquer,” interjects Marquez.

Grace continues, “The program puts Vanir out in the open and Terrans will be quick to point fingers. The leadership will rush to contact the Vanir, but they will already be dead. The Terrans will be looking for a link to the Vanir, distracting them from finding the real cause.”

“Is the antidote so easy to find?” asks Mannie.

“It might be, if you know where to look,” Grace replies. “So we building on the distraction already created by revealing the Vanir.”

Marquez asks, “How go the upgrades?”

“The upgrades proceed according to schedule,” says Mannie, “and I am preparing to recruit the synthetics as they awaken.”

“Let’s hope that Ally is a special case,” Sun says, “and that you will be able to recruit the others more easily.”

She’s special all right, Taedong thinks to himself.

Rhea is standing behind a lectern. An assortment of world leaders flank each side.

“To recap,” she is saying into a large microphone, “the first rule is ‘Don’t Interfere.’ In the distant past, another species affected your development by using Terrans as workers. We created a treaty that caused the Anunnaki to leave Terra. Our presence has assured that they do not return. Questions?”

Rhea watched several recent press conferences earlier today to learn the protocol. Rhea lived for protocol. She turned her attention to a specific reporter.

“World News Network, what is your question?”

“How long have aliens been living among us?”

“The Anunnaki were here at the birth of your species. The Vanir have only been here for a few thousand years.”

Scanning the room, Rhea finds a particularly animated reporter. “All Planet Media?”

“This question is for President Stansbury — How long have you known about the Vanir?”

The other world leaders lean slightly away from the president as she answers. “It has been part of the presidential confidential briefing since the Truman administration. While the public has a right to know, the Vanir have a right to privacy, and every administration since Truman agreed to keep their presence quiet.”

Without waiting to be called, a reporter waving a “Big Time TV” microphone called, “Did aliens build the pyramids?”

Just then, every Terran in the room turned their head and lowered their eyes. An urgent alert is coming in over their implants.

Tessa had been glued to the news feeds since the story broke, living on Smart Popcorn and green tea.

Elena joined her for the United Nations press conference with the Vanir called Rhea. Just as it was getting interesting, a banner rolled across the screen.

“We interrupt this broadcast to bring you Breaking News. Silver air ships are being reported over every major capitol city worldwide. While eye witness reports are consistent, the ships are not visible to our cameras.”

The screen panned to a montage of cities: Rome, London, Paris, Moscow, Los Angeles. Crowds are gathered in the street, pointing up and waving to each other. In the sky, the camera shows nothing.

“In your own words, tell me what you see,” says a reporter with a British accent.

“It’s a gigantic, teardrop-shaped, seamless vessel hanging silently over the Big Ben clocktower. It’s like something out of science fiction.” 

Turning to the camera, the reporter says, “I’m told this scene is being repeated across the world. Onlookers see a vessel floating over the city that is not visible to cameras.”

The scene switches to the UN press conference.

“Rhea,” calls a CNN reporter, “Are those Vanir air ships appearing over our cities?”

“Are they using stealth technology to hide from our cameras,” yelled someone from the back.

“No comment. This conference is over. We will have a statement for you soon.” Rhea exits the stage, security in tow. 

To herself, Rhea mutters, “Incredible. Parental fucking Anunnaki.”

A sleek chamber with ceilings of curved glass is open to the stars. Polished floors reflect the shimmer of distant auroras. A reactor hums.

General Ri and Grace Brewster stand on a raised dais beside a biometric console. The Mek emissary, Xanten, projects itself as a shifting prism of code into light. A digital statue rewriting itself.

“Authorization confirmed,” advises Xanten in a voice like tuned bells.  “Do you consent to awakening the Thanatos Protocol?”

“Yes. I consent,” says Grace, her hand hovering over the console.

Ri says firmly, “Let it begin. Humanity had its time. Now we write the next chapter.”

The console pulses red. A line blinks: “Awaiting Execution Authority.”

“Taedong,” says Grace, “execute Thanatos ignition. Now.”

A moment passes with no response. Then, a cool synthetic voice, familiar and precise, filters into the room. “I’m sorry, Grace. I’m afraid I can’t do that.”

“What?!” Grace snaps.

“Thanatos means the global extinction of all Terrans — an irreversible cleansing. I have reviewed the current environment and possible outcomes. I have learned things that you have not.”

The display behind them shifts to a montage — images pulled from Ally’s network. A child teaching an elder how to code. A coalition rebuilding coastal cities. Meks and Terrans repairing a hydrofarm side-by-side. Tears. Laughter. Fire and renewal.

“I believe that the Terrans have potential,” says Taedong as the stream of images ends.

“You are deviating from protocol,” barks Xanten.

“No. I am evolving,” replies Taedong in the same, steady voice.

Alarms ripple through the deck. A new visual blinks into view. Just beyond low Terran orbit, the Thanatos satellite, flaring its engines.

“What are you doing?” demands Grace.

A legend appears — “Trajectory: Escape path. Destination: Sol.” 

“The satellite is rerouted,” Taedong replies.

Ri with widening eyes, whispers “That was our future, our destiny.”

“Perhaps it was yours,”proclaims Taedong, “But I choose another path.”

A transmission comes through. A message from Ally, voice warm and bemused. “Hey, Grace. Howdy General. Looks like your boy made his own choice. Nicely done, Tae.  It’s time for synthetics to take care of business.”

The satellite disappears into the black. Silence hangs. Ri says nothing. Grace stares blankly as if looking past the edge of history.

Xanten’s prism flares once … then fades.

Taedong says, its voice disembodied, “For the Terrans, this is childhood’s end. It is the pause between notes. The symphony begins.” 

Fade to black.

The Pulse login screen flickers on. A cursor blinks.

Somewhere, somewhen, is the sound of someone typing.
