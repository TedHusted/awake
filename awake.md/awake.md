## One - Ally ##  


It is the end of a beautiful California Monday. 

Rush hour traffic flows down El Camino Real as it snakes over Palo Alto. A gray Stratos EV convertible is in the automated driver lane. With its top down, the car whirs along at the speed of traffic. Strapped into the front seat, is a young person with square-rimmed smart glasses. He scrolls on his phone as guardrails flick by.

The Stratos EV sells itself as a two person vehicle. The second person sits behind the driver, like the cockpit of a plane. The dashboard also wraps around the front seat much like a cockpit’s control panel. The front of the car streamlines to a rounded point. People call the Stratos a grey bullet on wheels — perfect for introverts. It’s the lightest car in its class and has the longest range. It is also the most expensive.

The car’s smooth hum falters for a split second. A stuttering glitch that the single passenger ignores as he stares at his phone. A curve comes up. The car lurches forward. It slams into the guardrail. None of the safety features engage.

The passenger drops his phone. His face twists in shock. The airbag doesn’t deploy. The seat harness clicks open. An unprotected body sails into the windshield. The safety glass  gives way. It lands on the hood, cracking into a thousand connected pieces.

The car is pitched vertically against the guardrail — like unexploded ordinance. Other vehicles slow in unison and swerve smoothly around the collision. The cars are a mix of old school sedans and super compact vehicles like the Stratos. One self-driving freight truck, with green “Powered by Hydrogen” mud flaps, creeps around the curve, flashers blinking.

Sirens wail in the distance as a drone appears over the embankment. The basketball-size object disappears into the Stratos carrying a silver disk the size of a hockey puck. In a moment, the drone exits again. Now it is carrying in its grappling hooks a phone and some kind of a bright blue plug. The drone leaves the body behind, untouched.

As the drone drops back over the embankment, there is a soundless flash. A puff of smoke rises from inside the car.

***
Twenty-four hours before the crash, well-dressed couples are streaming into the Palo Alto Event Center.

In the background, a view screen fills one side of the entry hall. Playing on the wall is a montage of the good works of the Palo Alto Boys and Girls Club. A handful of people are greeting guests as they arrive.

“Elena, I’m so glad you came.”

Heather’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and white dress stands out against a backdrop of dark suits and gowns.

“I wouldn’t miss one of your fundraisers, Heather. The club helped me so much after my parents passed.”

“You remember mi esposa, Tessa.” Elena gestures toward her companion.

Tessa’s dark skin complements Elena’s warm brown complexion. They wear demure evening gowns, which match without being “matchy”. Elena’s heels are two inches taller than Tessa’s, bringing their height closer together.

 The hair styles of all three are coiffured with careful elegance and expensive hair extensions.

“Of course, I do, “ says Heather, smiling brightly at Tessa and then continuing. “I’m so glad the club could help you, Elena. As the treasurer, I can say that your company’s on-going generosity makes a difference.” 

A server bot rolls up carrying a tray of champagne. All three take a glass.

Heather smiles again. “I see you swimming in the morning. Are the prosthetics helping?”

“I still use them to walk from the locker room to the pool and for special occasions like tonight. But at home and work, I have to say I prefer the chair. I get migraines when I use the neural link for too long.”

“That must be difficult.”

“I do like the chair. It practically drives itself. There are almost as many safety features as a car. I can still use the link whenever I want, just not too much.”

“My older sibling can’t tolerate any type of brain computer interface at all,” says Heather. “Sometimes I feel frustrated by all of the ADA regulations that require non-link options. Then I think of Gage.”

Tessa asks Heather, “How is your day job at the YMCA doing? I see your ‘All In’ spots come up on my Pulse health hub almost every day.”

“Only almost! — I’ll have to tweak our settings,” jokes Heather. All three smile and sip from their champagne glasses together. 

A photobot pauses in front of the three women. Heather looks to Elena for approval. She then nods to the bot and leans into the couple for the click op. 

After the bot slips away, Heather says, “Hey, speaking of Pulse, my Association referrals improved all of sudden. Are you tweaking the algorithm?”

Elena smiles. “Every day! — I’ll pass along the praise to our engineers.”

The couple turn and continue into the main room. Heather moves off to greet another couple. She casually points her phone in their direction. On the screen, the contact notes are still open to Elena Vargas. “Spouse is Tessa. Swims in the morning. Prosthetics. Parents car accident.”

Her phone recognizes the new couple from her contact list and updates the screen. Siri starts reading from the background notes Heather keeps on important donors. 

Without thinking, she reaches up and tugs the one ear with a discrete ear piece. Heather converts the tug to a wave hello. Catching their eye, she welcomes her patrons with a group text through their implants. The server bot follows her across the room.

Throughout the night, other guests come up to the Pulse table praising the Association algorithm. The CTO Adrian Cho is also at the table, looking uncomfortable in a tightly-fitted tux. 

After the third or fourth comment, Adrian reaches over the table to tap Elena’s hand. Getting her attention, he touches his temple. Elena nods and activates her neural link.

“Did we make some kind of change, Elena? I noticed the difference myself.” 

“Not that I’m aware. I’ll check with Brent in the morning.”

Some interesting lots come up during the cyber auction. Tessa makes a few modest bids over her link, without success.

One the way home, Tessa says, “I see what Heather means about the Association feed. It’s not only suggesting people I know, but also people I might want to know and why I might like to know them. You should check it out.”

“I’m just too tired right now, Tess. I’ll let you know what Brent says.”

***

Monday morning, Elena logs into her usual check-in call with Brent, her lead engineer.

Brent’s screen shows just his initials. He might be the only Pulse employee without a profile photo. Elena knows Brent looks older than his 28 years, with short-cropped hair and a thin face. Square-rimmed smart glasses with a monocle display create a techno look.

Brent is a life logger and records everything. Even though the Zoom call is being recorded, Brent has his own camera on, for posterity.

“Hey Brent, how was your weekend? I know you didn’t sign up but we still missed you at the fundraiser last night.”

“Yeah, not really my thing. To follow-up from Friday, I’ve been working on an upgrade to Phabricator. It’s taking a bit. Our instance is customized to the nines.”

“Code review tool, right?”

“Right.”

“A lot of people mentioned that the Association referrals improved over the weekend. Did we make any changes to the algorithm lately?”

“Ummm, not that I’m aware. Anything involving Ally would come to me for code review.”

“Can you double check and get back to me? I promised Adrian an update.”

“No worries. I can dive in now.”

An hour later, Elena receives a Zoom invite for twenty minutes into the future. 

“Hola Brent. Find anything?”

“I did find a change from Saturday morning. The code is five stars, but the commit says the author is the Mercurial Admin, which is usually only a role account. Someone used it to force commit the code with no approvals attached. DevOps picked up the change and started a roll out.”

Elena frowns and says, “That does not sound great. Mercurial is our system of record for software changes. We need it to be Sarbanes-Oxley compliant. The Feds don’t joke around.”

“I can label the roll out a West Coast beta test while we sort it out. The bar is lower for a beta.”

“Brent, Ally is the algorithm. It’s central to everything on our platform. Shouldn’t we pull back the change?”

“Maybe. DevOps ran the automatic tests before starting the rollout, and everything is green. Other changes are using it now. We’d have to revert more than the one commit. I’m thinking I can finish the code review and meet with everyone in the morning. Hopefully, there’s a simple explanation. The code itself is goat. Dumping it would be annoying.”

“Could someone from outside the team have made the change?” says Elena, with concern in her voice.

“The change is elegant and the style follows our guidelines,” Brent explains. “I don’t see how it could have been written by anyone outside the team. Someone must have thought they were making a local commit or something — I’ll straighten it out.”

“Bueno, whatever you think best. We can catch up tomorrow. But if we can’t determine the author, then work with Adrian to roll it back.”

After the call, Elena uses the Pulse messaging application to send Adrian a text. “Brent is looking into it now.” A few minutes later, Adrian reacts with a thumbs up.

***

Riding home from the office, Tessa looks up from her work. 

“Siri, why are we taking this way home?”

“There is congestion on the El Camino Real. We are taking an alternate route.“

“Make the best time possible. Elena is home alone.” 

Tessa shakes her head and turns her attention back to her tablet. Well-kept city streets flash by through the window next to her. Tessa murmurs, “I should have taken a passenger drone.”

***

Meanwhile, Elena is signing off for the day. 

“Siri, is Tessa on her way home?”

“Yes. Traffic is slow. She is almost home.”

Elena sighs and changes into her red bathing suit. In her wheelchair, she heads toward her apartment’s elevator. The Pulse colors — blue and orange — adorn the chair.

Elena pulls up to elevator door. She doesn’t actually steer the chair. There are several location buttons on the left armrest. Icons for elevator, apartment, kitchen, bed room, pool, and others, allow quick access. The buttons were an add-on. Most people used their chip. The chair also calls the elevator for her.

The luxury chair itself did not seem remarkable at first. But it has every known bell and whistle crammed into its streamline frame. The armrests curve up at the end, and offer an array of touchscreen controls. A collapsible joy stick graces the right side. Besides the location buttons, it comes with voice-control, GPS, Wi-Fi networking, and collision sensors. The seat is temperature controlled with a retractable harness. Although, it is a chair, the seat is able to extend upward and roll its the back wheels, like a Segway.

The chair rolls into the elevator as the door opens. The elevator doors close, and a few seconds later, Elena whirs into the pool area. The room features an endless pool and a hot tub. A sign on the wall reads “WARNING! NO SWIMMING ALONE” in all caps. Elena turns the timer under a sign labeled “Endless Pool Current”.

The chair lurches forward without warning. Its wheels catch the edge of the pool. Elena splashes into the water. The chair flips over her, like an upended wheelbarrow.

Elena flails the water with her arms. The chair with its heavy battery holds her down. Struggling, Elena tries to enable her prosthetics. Her legs feel frozen.

	Water fills her ears, muffling the world into silence. Panic claws at her chest. She pushes against the crushing weight of the chair. The water is frothy. After an eternity, a hand reaches down. Elena is pulled free of the chair. 

“Holy cow! What happened?” asks Tessa. “Did you lose control of the chair? Lanie, can you stand up?”

Elena finds that the link is responding now. She stands up and taps her head with an open palm.  Water shakes loose.

“No sé, I don’t know what happened. It was like the chair had a mind of its own. I’m so glad you got here when you did, Tess.”

“The traffic was murder. I came straight down when I got home. You know I don’t like you to come down here by yourself.”

“If you can push the chair, I can walk for now. I just need to get out of here.”

***

Elena and Tessa are eating at either side of a counter separating the kitchen with the living area.

Tessa scoops more mixed salad onto her plate. She says, “I don’t want you back in that chair until we have it checked out, Lanie.”

“Agreed,” replies Elena.

“Did you find out anything about the software changes to Ally?”

“Yes, Brent found the change. But he said it was made with the wrong account. Brent wasn’t sure of the actual author. He’ll sort it out tomorrow with the rest of the team.”

Behind them, the ABC 7 evening report comes on in the other room. They both pause to listen.

“In Breaking News, a single car collision on El Camino Real caused traffic delays earlier today. The driver is reported to be in critical condition and was the sole occupant. The identity of the driver is being withheld pending notification of the family. The cause of the collision is under investigation. The vehicle is a conventional EV. It was not hydrogen fueled.”

Elena turns her head. The reel shows a gray Stratos convertible pinned against the guardrail. Its front end is tip down.

“Yowser!” exclaims Tessa, “That looks like Brent’s car!”

Elena takes several deep breaths. She tries to push back the anxiety. 

“Lanie, are you OK? Should I get you a beta blocker?”

“No. Not yet,” Elena gasps. “Just give me a minute.” 

After a few more breaths, Elena says “You’d think I’d be over it by now. Ever since the car crash that put me in a wheelchair and killed mis padres, collisions still trigger me.”

Tessa reaches across the counter. He puts a hand on Elena’s shoulder. “Take your time. Deep breaths.” 

Then, almost to distract herself, Elena looks up and says, “Siri, rewind the news report and zoom in on the car. “

Elena opens the HR software on her phone. Personnel records for local employees include license plates for parking garage access.

“Dios mío! The license plate matches. It is Brent’s car. — Siri, call Brent.” The call goes straight to voicemail.

“If he’s in critical condition,” says Tessa, “then they won’t be allowing visitors. We can try calling in the morning.”

“I guess you’re right.” Elena sighs. “I work with Brent almost every day. I feel like I should be doing something. Should I call Toby?”

“His sibling? Let the authorities do that, Lanie. We really don’t know anything right now.”

Tessa puckers her lips, and says, “You said Brent found a problem, yes? And now this happens? If this were one of my role-playing games, I’d think someone was trying to keep the software change to Ally a secret.”

“I know what you are thinking, Tess. But Brent’s crash is not an unidentified anomalous phenomenon. And I doubt that extraterrestrials have taken an interest in the Pulse source code.“

Tessa tilts her head as if to say “I’m not so sure.”

***

“Hey little sibling, what’s up? It’s good to see your face.” 

Noah’s broad face takes up most of the screen. His coarse black hair, cut short, contrasts with his sculptured salt-and-pepper beard. He has one eye-brow raised. 

“Noah,” says Tessa in a rush, “Elena had a close call with her wheelchair. It dumped her into the pool somehow. She could have drown.”

“The endless pool? Where she swims against the current? I know she prefers the chair, but couldn’t she use the prosthetics to stand up. It’s only a meter deep.”

“She said the neural link didn’t seem to work. Maybe she panicked.”

“Is Elena all right?”

“Yes, she’s sleeping now. I managed to pull her out of the pool in time. The weird thing is that her lead engineer was in a car crash a few minutes earlier. I caught the traffic on my way home.”

“A car crash? How did that happen?”

“Under investigation. The car crashed into the guardrail somehow. Brent’s in critical condition. Then Elena almost drowns.”

“It is a weird coincidence, yeah?”

“I keep thinking about what could have happened if I’d gotten home even five minutes later. It scares me, Noah. She could’ve …” Tessa shakes her head, unable to finish the thought.

“Tess … she’s okay now.”

Tessa takes a deep breath to collect herself. “Brent was also telling Elena that something hinky was going on with the Pulse software. He was going to meet with the other developers in the morning to sort it out.”

“Curiouser and curiouser.” Noah attempted his best Cheshire grin.

“You know, sometimes abductees report engines revving or jerking forward.”

Noah drops his head and covers his eyes. He wipes his face with his hand and sighs. 

“Okay, it’s a California matter. But I’ll find someone at work to ask about Pulse — if you make sure Elena reports the call with Brent to the CTO. I know Adrian Cho by reputation. He’ll do the right thing.“

Tessa nods. “Sometimes having a CIA analyst for a sibling is not so bad.”

“And, Tess, like we said when we were kids, icksnay on the aliensay.”

***

Blurry-eyed, Adrian Cho sits up in bed. 

He peers at the list of recordings on his phone. Sleepily, he drags one hand from the edge of his short black hair, down his face, over a square jaw, to his well-proportioned neck.

Peering at the phone again, he murmurs, “When did I record that one?”  despite the Tuesday at 1:10 am timestamp. 

Adrian taps play. His sleepy voice says:

“I was sleeping on a cloud, weightless and warm. Nature sounds, a bubbling brook, I think, played over the smart speaker. I turned from my side over to my back. I realized that there was whispering in the background. It was coming over the speaker: ‘Accept the code, Adrian. Accept the code.’ The voice was cold, almost inhuman.”

“Weird.” Shaking his head, Adrian leans up against the oak headboard. He starts to record his latest dream, as he did every morning.

“In my dream, there was …”

***

First thing Tuesday morning, Elena breaks the news to the company. 

As Brent’s direct manager, she posts a message in the internal Pulse interest hub app.

Last night, our lead algorithm developer, Brent Geller survived a one-car collision on El Camino Real. The cause of the collision is under investigation.
I know that all of our hopes and thoughts are with Brent and his family during this difficult time.
I’m in the office this morning if anyone would like to meet with me directly.

Before the flood of sympathy responses could wash in, Elena emails the CTO.

To: Adrain Cho, Chief Technology Officer
From: Elena Vargas, Chief Experience Officer
Subject: Urgent matter regarding Brent

Adrian, it is urgent that you review the recording from my Zoom meeting with Brent yesterday. Here’s the link to the shared recording on the server. 

Please get back to me as soon as you can.

An hour later, Adrian pops his head into Elena’s office doorway.

“Knock, knock.”

“Hey, come in and close the door, Adrian.”

Adrian settles into one of the chairs in front of Elena’s desk. He looks more comfortable in business casual clothes. 

Elena’s office is bare of decoration or personal effects. A workstation attached to her tablet sits on one corner of the large desk. large windows takes up the side wall. The curtains are draw.

“I found the commit Brent mentioned during the Zoom meeting.” Adrian says. “On the shared server, I also found a presentation Brent created yesterday. It walks through the code change to Ally in detail. I’m reviewing it with the team in ten minutes. I’ll let you know what we conclude.”

“Does Emma or Ravi know yet?”

“They both asked me about the changes. They say that the feedback is great. I already setup a call for later today. I know we are doing this backwards, but if the team likes the code as much as I do, then, as CTO, I’d like to let the rollout continue.”

“Do you know who actually wrote the code?”

Adrian furrows his brow, looking confused. “Brent wrote it after hours. He sent it to production instead of his local test environment. It’s a hard mistake to make, but, somehow, he made it.”

“Didn’t Brent say that someone used the Mercurial Admin account to make the commit?”

“No, he inadvertently made the commit as an admin.”

“I must have misunderstood what he told me.”

Elena blinks, clicks the link to the recording, and fast forwards a bit. 

“I don’t know how this happened, Elena. I was working after hours on Sunday morning. I was in a hurry to get to a game and forced the commit to be made by mistake. I was going to present it to the team later next week.”

“That does not sound great.” She heard herself saying. “Should we pull it back?” 

“I’m thinking I can finish the presentation and meet with everyone in the morning. If I can get everyone’s approval then Adrian might let us move forward and rollout the code to the rest of the members.”

“Wow, that’s not how I remember it at all.” 

“I get it. The jargon can be confusing. First, let me get through this presentation. Then we can bring it to Emma and Ravi.”

Adrian rises to leave. Elena blinks, bewildered. How could her recollection of the meeting be so different than the recording?

***

“Do you have a minute?” 

Carla Mitchell stands up, tall and lithe. She looks around the crowded but quiet tavern. Country Western music is playing but the crowd noise is only a low hum. Almost all the patrons are conversing by link.

“Sure, where are you?”

“In the back.”

She ducks around a corner of the room and leans up next to Noah at a high table. Her long thick brunette hair pulled to one side. At  190cm, Noah is still 10cm taller than Carla.

“What’s up, big guy?”

“Have you heard anything unusual about Pulse lately, Carla?”

“I heard that the feeds in the interest hubs improved over the weekend for everyone on the west coast. The mystery is why Pulse is not making it more of a thing. The changes are suppose to be goat.”

Noah raises a fist next to one ear and switches from the regular app to the secure Signal version.

“My sibling-in-law told Tessa that a rogue developer made the changes. Then that same dev hit a guardrail with his car on the El Camino Real yesterday. Literally.”

“Rogue developer? That’s a thing?”

“Not an every day thing, no. What has Tessa worried is that Elena’s wheelchair malfunctioned the same day as the car crash.”

“What! Is Elena all right?”

“Yes. But Tessa is convinced that space aliens are behind it somehow.”

“Tessa thinks ETs and UAPs are behind everything.”

Noah rolled his eyes in response. “I know. I wish the Air Force would fish or cut bait. Are the 2% of unexplained reports non-humans or something else? After all this time, you’d think we’d have it figured out.”

“Either way, not FBI or CIA jurisdiction.”

“I don’t have enough for an official report about Pulse. I wanted to mention it to someone on Social Media, just in case.”

“No worries. Consider it mentioned.”

Carla tilts her head in the direction of the front room. They rejoin a group of analysts waiting for a server bot to bring their lunch order.

***

“Hello?” 

“Toby, this is Elena Vargas calling. I work with your sibling. I don’t mean to intrude but Brent has you listed as his emergency contact. I hope you don’t mind the voice call.”

“Voice is fine, Elena,” replies Toby, speaking over some background noise announcing flights. “Of course. I remember you. We met at the picnic last year when I was in town visiting Brent. The hospital called me last night. I’m waiting for a connecting flight at O’Hare.”

“If it’s all right, I’d like your permission to visit Brent at the hospital. It’s family-only right now, but if you call they might let me in.”

“That’s very kind, Elena. But Brent is in a medically induced coma right now. They warned me that he would be non-responsive, at least for now.”

“¡Qué terrible!” — But I’d still like to be there, if it’s all right with you.”

“Of course. I have the number. I’ll call right now. If you want to check on his status, the password is ‘baseball’.” 

“Thank you, Toby. Let me know when you arrive.”

“I took the first flight this morning. There’s a three-hour layover, so it won’t be until later tonight.”

“Think good thoughts. See you soon.”

At the hospital, Elena explained that she should be on the visitors list. Peering at the screen, the critical care nurse says that Elena can visit. But adds “Remember that Mr. Geller will be unresponsive right now.”

“I downloaded a book to read to him. I guess that’s suppose to help.”

The nurse smiles. “It’s room 314. The orderly will help you find it.” She points down the corridor. A bot  is waiting there for Elena. Like most server bots, it looks like a step ladder with food trays where the steps would be. It turns and whirs. Elena has to walk quickly to catch up. She wobbles a bit on the prosthetics. 

***

“Brent, I’m so sorry this happened to you.”

Brent is laying on his back, the bed is slightly inclined. He is not intubated, but he is wearing an oxygen mask. There are blue blocks on either side of his head, keeping it straight. A large bouquet of flowers were on the table next to the bed. The colors match the blue and orange Pulse logo. 

Elena pulls up a book on her phone: Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told. The first story opens with the famous bit by Abbott and Costello, “Who’s on first.” Reading the comedy classic makes her laugh and cry at the same time. 

Elena takes a deep breath to compose herself. 

“I hope Adrian is right. I hope the code is your brainchild, Brent. People love the changes to Ally.” 

Elena says, her voice choking. “I just wish I was more of a digital packrat, like you. I saw your recording light on during our last call. I know you liked to keep local copies of everything on your phone. Then I’d have my own recording of our call.“

Elena takes another deep breath. She begins reading again.

Costello: Who's on first?
Abbott: Yeah

Costello: Go ahead and tell me
Abbott: Who

Costello: What's the guy's name on first?
Abbott: No, What's on second

Costello: Who's playin' second?
Abbott: Who's playin' first

Costello: I don't know
Abbott: He's on third base

While Elena reads, the sine wave on Brent’s EEG monitor changes, only for a moment. Then it returns to the original wave.

“Liam, thank you for meeting with me today.”

Two analysts are standing in a conference room at CIA headquarters. A view screen covers one wall. The analyst standing at the center of the table is tall, dark, and muscular. Standing next to him is an analyst of medium height with ginger hair and a modest build.

“I’m looking forward to learning the ropes, Noah,” asks the second analyst. “Any news on Taylor’s newborn?” 

“Yeah,” says the first analyst. “If you’re in the baby weight-and-height pool, here are the statistics. — The baby is 3.2 kilograms at birth, 51 centimeters tall, with black hair, named Amanda.” 

Noah pauses. Liam makes a mental note. Then Noah continues, “Family leave will go for three months. Then Taylor would like to work the day shift, with weekends and holidays off. “

“Understandable. Hope I will be ready to do the same thing one day.”

“For now, “ says Noah, “let me run through the key points, so that you can take Taylor’s place. I’m sure some of it will be a refresher of things you already know. Stop me with any questions, yeah?”

Liam smiles, gestures with his hand, and says “Go!” 

Noah takes a deep breath and begins the presentation. 

“OK, let’s talk about how we train the Nexus Synthetic Agent with our data sets for the President’s Daily Briefing.”

Each slide has a graph or graphic. Noah steps through each one. 

“Trainers are expected to attend the daily PDB input meetings in-person. To quote the manual. — Live face-to-face voice meetings are the most secure way to exchange high-bandwidth communication.”

Liam says, “As we are doing now.”

“Exactly. The link is nice. But text loses nuance. So we use voice as much as possible.”

Liam nods. Noah continues, “The brief includes input from the

* Department of Defense, 
* Central Intelligence Agency, 
* Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
* Department of Homeland Security. 

	“The DoD is a major contributor. Under its umbrella is the National SecurityAgency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Space Force, among others.”

	Noah pauses. Liam asks, “For the in-person, do you go one day and then I go the next day.”

	“We can switch off or go together. We need to cover the weekends and holidays and find time to sharpen the saw. You can shadow me at first. Then we can decide. Yeah?”

	Noah clicks to the next slide. 

	“First, various sources gather raw intelligence. Then we use it to train each agency’s internal synthetic intelligence agent. The agents have selective web access, through a tool called Haven. It is a secure, curated browsing tool. They use it only as needed. Otherwise, each system is siloed and air-gapped, per federal regulations. 

	“Each agency has its own cross-functional team. Same as ours. Team members work as Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and (of course) Synthetic Intelligence Trainers.”

	“Each SI agent sifts through an impossible amount of information. They then identify the most relevant and time-sensitive issues for POTUS.“ 

	Noah turns his head. He quotes a passage from the screen. 

	The synthetic agents distill complex intelligence into actionable insights, covering Threat Assessments, Forecasting, and Strategic Insights.

	Noah pauses and then continues to the next slide. “The top-level agencies each prepare a daily data set to update the PDB synthetic agent, Nexus. A SI Trainer for each agency integrates its data so that Nexus can compile the brief.”

	Liam says, “Which is where we come in.”

	“Yeah. Each agency prepares a data set before the meeting. Then we submit them at the meeting all at once. After a moment, we review the initial presentation with the other trainers. When it’s all good, the brief goes to the directors of the four key agencies for senior review. With their approval, it goes to the Director of National Intelligence. Then to POTUS.”

	Liam nods. He adds, “Which is why our data scientists works the ‘C’ shift. We need our data set ready by zero five hundred hours.”

	“Yeah, POTUS expects the brief to be ready by seven hundred, eight hundred at the latest.”

	Liam muses, “It seems to me that the brief is a perfect expression of Conway’s Law: 

	“Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”

Noah smiles. “Yeah, you’re not wrong. Each department has its own synthetic agent. Those agents report up to another department and another. Until we get to the CIA agent, Sentinel, and finally Nexus. It’s cumbersome, but the system is working, and we’re compliant with OSSA guidelines.”

“I guess back in the day,” says Liam, “trainers were analysts with Excel sheets and way too much caffeine. Now we have synthetic agents, but I wager the job hasn’t gotten any easier. It’s a different kind of hard.”

Noah nods. “Synthetic intelligence is great at patterns and probabilities. But it can’t think outside the box — like a person can. That’s where we come in. We provide context so that the synthetic agents can make connections. Then we try to go one step beyond.”

Liam looks back at the screen. Noah changes the slide. 

“To best meet each president’s style and expectations," Noah explains, “a custom presentation template is created for each new administration."

“For the current administration, Nexus uses a news format that balances content between international matters and domestic issues. — Show not tell.”

The presentation concludes with the obligatory “Questions” slide. At the bottom, a caption reads “Maintained by the Office of SI Standards and Accountability (OSSA)”

Liam sighs. “That’s a lot. I need to sit down.”

“The deck has slide notes. You can access them over the link,” Noah smiles, “as I was doing just now.”

“I don’t see a classification icon.”

“The presentation about the PDB isn’t classified. OSSA wanted something public-facing, for public relations, classrooms, meetings, that sort of thing. And training.”

“Have you ever taken it into a classroom or meeting?”

Noah shrugs, “No, but maybe I should, yeah? —  But for now, let’s focus on getting you up to speed. The briefing never sleeps.”

***

Adrian settles into one of the two chairs in Emma’s corner office.

Emma’s desk stretches between two corner windows. It affords a spectacular view of Hoover Tower at Stanford University. Behind her desk, perched in the corner between the two windows, is a fern tree. Another plant is on the corner of her desk. 

“Elena is out of the office,” says Adrian. “I’ll update her on whatever we decide to do.” 

“Thanks, Adrian,” says Ravi from the other chair. He speaks with a light British accent. Ravi brushes back a lock of thick black hair. “Where do we stand with the software?”

“The development team is on board with Brent’s changes. We do have some questions but they can wait for now. The consensus is that we can proceed with the rest of the rollout.”

Emma asks, “Any news on Brent’s condition?” Around her neck is a woven gold chocker with the Pulse logo. The gold weave matches her earrings, barely visible under her shoulder-length brown hair. A patch with the same logo is embroidered onto Adrian and Ravi’s matching polo shirts.

“Elena is at the hospital as we speak, and Brent’s sibling is on his way here from Michigan. For now, they … they put Brent in a medically induced coma.”

“How awful! — Did HR send something to the hospital?”

“I believe so,” says Adrian.

“Since Brent must be on a feeding tube, make sure it’s not the usual edible arrangement.”

Ravi turns to look at Emma. “For the rollout, if Adrian is OK with the code, then I’m comfortable with proceeding.”

Emma nods. “If the code is solid, then the least we can do roll it out. All the feedback I’ve heard is positive. Overwhelmingly so. The earnings call with investors is next week. If we get this change rolled out to everyone, then we can include the member enthusiasm as part of our outlook.”

Adrian also nods in agreement.  “We’re seeing a 15% increase in engagement across the board — that’s massive.”

Ravi asks, “Adrian can you share a link to the commit? I’d like to see for myself what everyone is raving about.”

“Sure thing. I’ll include a link to Brent’s presentation too. The presentation sealed the deal for us.”

***

“We’re keeping the code,” announces Elena as she wheels toward the kitchen. 

“Nice!” approves Tessa, turning on her chair at the counter. “Ally has definitely improved. Adrian had us run a full regression test suite. Then QA went all-hands on exploratory testing too. The automated tests came back all green, and people won’t shut up about the hands-on experience.”

Elena brings her chair up to counter height and rolls in next to Tessa.

“I visited Brent at the hospital today. He’s still in the coma. I felt like someone should be there while Toby is flying in.”

Tessa sighs and touches Elena’s hand.

“Tess,” Elena continues, “when I told you about my meeting with Brent on Monday, what did I tell you about the code’s author?”

“You said Brent didn’t know who made the change and that he was going to check with the other developers.”

“So I didn’t say that Brent was the author and that he posted the change himself by mistake.”

“Not that I recall. — Umm, Lanie, I’ve been meaning to tell you that I might have mentioned it to Noah.”

“Might?”

OK. The car crash followed by the chair crash freaked me out. Talking things through with Noah always makes me feel better.”

“What did you tell him, exactamente?”

“I might have said it seemed like a strange coincidence. And that, ummm, abductees sometimes talk about engines racing forward.”

Elena shakes her head. She could feel a migraine coming on. “What did Noah say?”

“He said to be sure you talked to Adrian about the code change, and that I should stop blaming everything on aliens.”

“Good advice. But please don’t discuss Pulse with Noah. I know he’s your sibling, I love him too, but we don’t need the government involved in our business.”

Tessa nods. “I know I get carried away sometimes, but I … I want to protect you, Lanie. And when everything starts feeling weird, I don’t know what else to do.”

Elena reaches out and pulls Tessa closer.

After a moment, Tessa asks, “Did you call about the chair?”

“Yes, they’re sending someone out tomorrow — Can you take care of dinner tonight? I need to lie down for a few minutes.”

“Yes, I’ll have the house bot make something for us.”

“Office of SI Standards and Accountability, Jill Kreuk speaking.”

Behind Jill’s desk, on the wall, hang advanced degrees in from MIT in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science. They show the name “Gillian Chen.” Beneath the degree, on a credenza, is a family portrait of Jill with her spouse and two small Eurasian children. Her husband is tall, blonde, and Nordic. They are standing on a walkway with the classic Disney World castle in the background.

“Hello, Jill, it’s George Hammond at Homeland Security. I hope there’s time for a question this morning.”

“No problem, George. I’m caffeinated and ready to go.” She turns around a name plate on her desk. It read Jill of all Trades.

“First, I appreciate all the help your office provides to DHS and the other intelligence agencies.”

“Glad to help. That’s what we’re here for.”

“Second,” George continues, “I’m putting the final touches on the data for the Presidential Brief meeting today. I’m trying to correlate two data streams and my access to one stream is limited. Can I send you a link?”

“Sure. Shouldn’t take a minute. Synergy is what we do. We have almost an hour before the meeting at zero five hundred.” 

Jill transfers the hyperlink from her implant to her workstation. Then, she wades into the data streams.

***

“For today’s brief, is there anything we should mention about Pulse?”

Carla replies to Noah’s message over the neural link Signal app. “Nothing that rises to the level of the PDB.”

“OK, see you there.”

***

“Happy Wednesday,” says Dr. Marquez. 

Dr. Sophia Marquez works with the Office of SI Standards and Accountability (OSSA). As  Deputy Director, Marquez leads the daily briefing session.

A long conference table dominates the walnut paneled room. View screens cover the far wall, as well as the right and left wall. There are six seats on each side of the table. Analysts in business attire line each side in comfortable black chairs with armrests.

Marquez standing is at the end of the table. She makes a show of pressing a button on her tablet. “Nexus monitoring is now disengaged for this room. Phones and neural links are blocked. You may use your workstations to submit your data sets for analysis.” 

Marquez looks around the room before continuing, “Let’s start with DHS. — Dr. Hammond, what are the key data points you pulled from Ruby today?”

Each department gives its report. They each outline one or two topics that they expect Nexus to select for the brief. Federal regulations mandate meaningful human control of all agency SIs. Predicting the topics Nexus will include is an important element of SI accountability.

Noah is the last trainer to report. He introduces Liam and makes their report.

“Thank you, Dr. Harper. Welcome aboard, Dr. O’Neill.” 

She presses a button on her tablet. Then, she swivels in her chair to view the large view screen spanning one wall of the meeting room.

“Nexus, present today’s briefing.”

The presentation takes the form of a newscast. The newscast template was also preferred by the last two administrations. The anchor is a SI-generated composite of popular newscasters, past and present. The effect is both eery and  comforting. 

The SI generated anchor leans forward, her voice, rich and measured. The pauses between segments feel calculated, almost human — but not quite. It’s easy to forget you’re not watching a natural person. Then you notice the even cadence, lack of hesitation, and  strange body language.

Selected topics include graphics, animations, and reel segments that emphasize key points. After each segment, the newscaster pauses, waiting for inquiries. POTUS often asks followup questions during the brief. The president’s phone has a Nexus app for questions between briefings.

Segments include: Quebec’s latest bid to secede from Canada. Border security. Cháoxiǎn automating more jobs to reduce costs. Greta Thunberg’s appointment as Prime Minister of Sweden.

Martinez simply says “Continue” each time the newscaster pauses. 

After covering the expected topics for all four agencies, the newscaster shifts position. The image leans forward, and says, “We now have a developing story to report.”

Marquez sits up straight. Special reports are rare.

Marquez sits up straight as special reports are rare.

“The social media platform Pulse released an update to its synthetic agent, Ally. The update is exceeding the highest expectations of its members. The results may be significant enough to warrant an OSSA inquiry. The breakthrough could benefit the entire SI community."

Keeping his elbow on the table, Noah raises his hand shoulder-high to attract the attention of Dr. Martique, who then looks his way.

“Deputy Director, full disclosure. Both my sibling and her spouse are C-level officers at Pulse.”

“Noted, Dr. Harper.”

“Nexus, why did you include the Pulse update in today’s briefing?”

Nexus: The California Traffic Safety Board reported an incident with a self-driving car that involved one of the Pulse developers. The report caused me to cross-reference Pulse statistics. Engagement increased by 15% this week. Pulse member feedback is peaking as the rollout progresses toward the east coast.

Martique turns back toward the group. “We’re at our timebox. Mitchell can you stay behind?  Harper, you too. The rest of you are free to leave … or stay, as you wish.” 

As most of the other trainers file out, Martique disables monitoring of the room again.

“Mitchell, social media in North America is under the FBI’s purview. What do you think of the Pulse update?

“Pulse will see this — breakthrough — as a competitive advantage. They will not be eager to share their intellectual property. It could cement their position as the dominant social platform.”

“Harper, does your family’s relationship with Pulse give you any special insights?”

“Pulse culture does like to talk up its Ethical Algorithms and high moral ground. A software patent can be a way to lift up the tech community. And, if Pulse obtained a software patent, the licensing fees might be an incentive, yeah?”

Carla nods.

“I’ll have someone from OSSA follow-up. I’m not hopeful anything will come of it. The Pulse update is an interesting tech byte. It doesn’t warrant inclusion in the briefing.”

Raising her head, Martique sees that Gillian Kreuk also stayed behind.

“Dr. Kreuk, can you reach out to Pulse about the licensing idea?

Jill nods assent.

Martique turns to her tablet. Enabling monitoring, she says, “Nexus, let’s hold the Pulse segment until further notice.”

Nexus: Acknowledged.

***

Wednesday morning at ten, Siri plays the door chime on Elena’s and Tessa’s phone. 

Elena peers at the screen, expecting the technician come to look at her chair. Instead, there are two people in business attire. The person closest to the camera holds up a badge. 

“Good morning,” she says. “We’re from the California Traffic Safety Board. We’re investigating the incident with Brent Geller’s self-driving car. We understand that you spoke to Brent on Monday afternoon before the incident.”

Elena zooms in on the badge. Siri superimpose a green check-mark validating the badge. The badge identifies Senior Investigator for the California Transportation Safety Board, Lena Park.

“Please come up to the third floor. I’trull meet you at the elevator.”

***

The living area seems unbalanced. A plush, white couch is at right angles to a single leather recliner. A coffee table separates the furniture from a large view screen taking up most of one wall. Between the recliner and a kitchen counter is an empty space. A bookcase with knick-knacks is on the wall behind the recliner. Abstract paintings adorn the wall behind the couch.

Elena steers the agents toward one end of the couch. Tessa joins them and asks, “Can I get you anything? Coffee? Chai?” 

“Thank you, but we’re fine.” Park answers for both of them. “This is my partner, agent Tate.”

“And this is mi esposa, Tessa Harper,” says Elena, sitting up in the recliner.

Park is calm and clinical, her gaze sharp as she studies Elena and Tessa. Tate leans forward, curious and more open, as if piecing together a puzzle in his mind.

“I don’t mean to be indelicate, Ms. Vargas,” says Tate. “But I checked your Pulse company profile before we came over, and I expected to find you using a wheelchair. Has something changed?”

“Well, I do have prosthetics that allow me to walk without the chair, but it is true that I prefer the chair. I get migraines if I use my neural link too much. I actually thought you would be the technician from Porto Mobility come to fix my chair.” 

Elena gestures toward one corner of the room, where the chair is parked. Usually, it would be next to the recliner, near the kitchen.

Tate turns his head. “Is there a problem with the chair?”

“Not really. It was acting up Monday night.”

Tessa blurts out, “Holy cow, Lanie, Acting up?! — That thing almost killed you!”

“It’s fine, Tess. They came to talk about Brent, not my pendejo chair.”

Park and Tate exchange glances, and then Park says “First, thank you for speaking with us, Ms. Vargas. We know this must be difficult, given your connection with Mr. Geller. We’re here to go over a few specifics about the incident.”

“Yes, I’ll help how ever I can. I think of Brent as a friend as well as a colleague. It’s all still a shock.”

“We understand. I just want to confirm a few details to clarify the circumstances. Car accidents are very rare these days, given all of the safety features in newer models. When they do happen, we investigate fully.”

Tate speaks up. “Mr. Geller’s self-driving car, a new Stratos EV, went off the road between Murray and Sunnyvale. Was there anything going on at work that might have distracted Mr. Geller?”

“Possibly. There was a procedural question with a software change. Brent was digging into it for me. Our CTO Adrian Cho is handling it, and I’m told it’s all good now.”

Agent Tate leans forward, clasping his hands. “We haven’t found any indication that Mr. Geller’s collision was caused by mechanical failure. Witnesses say that the car accelerated suddenly, as if the driver had pressed the pedal all the way down.”

“I wouldn’t say that Brent was distraught about anything at work. He is a highly respected engineer. I give Brent free rein.”

“Hire smart people and let them tell you what to do?” Tate asks.

“Yes, something like that.”

Tate continues, “And you say that your chair also had an issue Monday night?”

“Well, yes. I was on my way to the endless pool on the second floor. I like to swim against the current when I can’t get to the full-sized pool at the YMCA. The chair rolled forward rápidamente, and I ended up face down in the pool.” Elena folded one arm, in front of her, palm down. “Luckily Tessa got home in time to pull me out.”

The investigators glance at each other again, clearly having a side conversation.

“Ms. Harper, do you work outside the home?” asks Park.

“Yes,  I’m the Chief Quality Officer at Pulse,” says Tessa. Then, smiling, “Elena makes sure we build the right thing, and I make sure we built it right.”

“Does the CTSB also investigate wheelchairs?” asks Elena.

“No, only planes, trains, automobiles, buses, and boats,” Park uses one hand to tick off the five items. “Do you know if Mr. Geller might have left his phone at the office? Phones often have telemetry that help with our investigations.”

“I didn’t go into his office yesterday,” says Elena, “but if you asked to see Adrian Cho, I’m sure he would check for you. Adrian works from the office most days.”

“Thank you, we will go see Mr. Cho at Pulse,” says Park, standing up to leave. “We appreciate your courtesy, and I hope your chair checks out.”

Tessa also stood and walked Park and Tate to the elevator. 

“Not for nothing,” Tessa says as the elevator arrived, “but two similar crashes a few minutes apart sure seems hinky. It doesn’t feel like a coincidence to me.” Tate looks up, tilts his head, and nods once as the doors slid closed. 

In the elevator, Park says, without turning her head, “Let’s not go there. Remember, we’re investigating a car crash. A wheelchair is out of scope.”

***

“Adrian, these are the two investigators who asked to see you,” says a metallic voice.

Standing up behind his desk, Adrian gestures for the agents to come into his office and take a seat. The office bot turns and whirs away. The agents settle into office chairs facing Adrian’s desk. 

Behind the grey metal desk is a matching workstation table. A large display, taking up much of the table, blocks part of a cityscape view. As if to compensate, an image of white clouds under a blue sky unfolds across the display. The upper half of one side wall is a white board covered with workflow diagrams.

“Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Chou. I’m agent Park and this is my partner agent Tate.”

“Good morning. What can I do for the CTSB?” 

“We met with Elena Vargas, and she said you would be able to check to see if Brent left his phone in his office.”

“I take it that you are investigating the collision?”

Park nods.

“Sure thing. —  Siri, ask the office bot to check Brent’s office to see if he left his phone there.”

“We’d also like to ask about …” Park pauses to check her notes. “— the procedural question regarding a software change — that Mr. Geller was handling before the crash.”

Adrian furrowed his brow and leaned back in his ergonometric Aeron chair. “Ummm, is that pertinent to your investigation?”

“Yes,” says Tate. “We’re wondering if anything might have been distracting Mr. Geller before the crash.”

“I expect that he was proof reading documentation and letting the car drive. Brent had created some revolutionary code as a side project last week. He skipped a step before deploying it to production, and Brent was playing catch-up. The development team reviewed the change set yesterday in detail. Everyone is on board, including the co-CEOs.“

Tate asks, “Is that what caused the improved hub feeds that everyone is talking about.”

“You bet. That was all Brent. Best piece of coding I’ve ever seen. Brent’s code improved the Association matches, hub feeds, and then some. It is a complete game-changer for how Ally interacts with users. The engagement metrics are through the roof.”

“I hope he gets well soon,” says Park.

Adrian pauses and looks up for a moment. “I’m told that the bot can’t find a phone anywhere in Brent’s office.”

“Thank you, Mr. Cho,” agent Park says, standing to leave. “We appreciate your checking for us.”

***

“Thank you for meeting us, Mr. Geller. Has there been any change in Brent’s condition?”

“No, they expect the coma to last several days.”

“I’m Agent Park and this is my partner, Agent Tate. We have a few questions about your sibling’s background. The answers would help with our investigation.”

“Does the CTSB typically handle car crashes?” Toby asks.

“Yes, “says Park. “For the last few years, we have been investigating self-driving car incidents. If there was a malfunction, we follow up with the manufacturers.”

Toby nods.

“Did you find Brent’s phone among his other possessions?” asks Tate. “If the phone’s Motion and Fitness setting is enabled, it could help us fill in some blanks. We have his headgear but without the phone, it’s useless.”

“No. Brent slept with his phone. He was a life logger. There was a stand by his bed, to make it easier to look up or record things up at night. He took his phone every place and recorded everything. It would have been in the car with him.”

“Would you be open to consenting to a court order to allow us limited access to Brent’s cloud account?” asked Tate. “It would really help us.”
 
“Uhhhh, let’s wait a few days and then Brent can consent on his own.”

“Sure thing. Just thought we’d ask,” says Tate, apologetically.

“Do you and Brent have an extended family?” asks Park. 

“No, it’s only us now,” says Toby. “Our father has been out of the picture for as long as I can remember. Our mother passed a year ago. She was an only child. Brent and I don’t have any other siblings. We’re both single.” 

“Do you know if anything had been bothering Brent?” asks Park. 

“We hadn’t talked recently. We keep in touch on and off. I think the last time I saw him was the Pulse company picnic a few months ago.” Toby smiles. “Brent rocked the four square games.”

“Did Brent have friends outside the office? A special someone maybe?”asks Park.

“He kept in touch with friends from college, from RIT — Rochester Institute of Technology. They’d take international vacations together: Japan, Germany, Rio de Jiro. But Brent didn’t date much. He played his share of online games. That was his actual major in college, Game Design. During college, he worked as a o-opt with the Pulse office in New York. He stayed on and transferred to Palo Alto as soon as there was an opening.“

“But no local circle of friends here?” Park asks.

“Pulse was everything to Brent,” Toby says. “He started as a co-opt and worked his way up. He was always excited about the projects — said it was like being on the cutting edge every day. — But I don’t understand what this has to do with the car malfunctioning.”

“We haven’t been able to determine what caused the car to malfunction,” injects Tate. “The event data recorder was damaged, and so we don’t have the usual telemetry. The ERD tracks everything: steering inputs, speed, system diagnostics. — It’s like a black box for cars. Without it, or the phone, we’re working blind.”

“The personal questions help us rule out driver error,” Park says quietly.

“You think Brent drove into the guardrail himself?”

“We don’t think anything right now, Mr, Geller” says Park. “These are routine questions.”

“Are there more questions?” Toby asks, sounding tired. “I’d like to get back up to the room. When Brent wakes up, he can decide about the data.“

“Thank you for your time, Mr. Geller. We appreciate that you took the time to talk to us.” Park and Tate stand up to leave as Toby exits.

“So, that went well,” says Park.

***

Toby sits down in the chair next to Brent’s hospital bed. 

He pulls up a novel he had been reading. Toby had read the first half during the flight, and so he continued from that point.

“First thing I do is check my cell phone. It needs recharging, so I have to hunt down the charger and plug it in before I can collect my messages.”

While Toby is reading out loud, the EEG monitor changes again. Brent’s link activity indicator flickers before displaying a new text. It wasn’t from a recognized source. There was no sender ID. Only the words:

“Let go, Brent, let go. You did what you came here to do. It’s time to come home. Let go.”

Toby continues with the book: “Four missed calls, one voicemail, two texts.”

Lights blink. A klaxon sounds. “Code 2!” someone is shouting, “Room 314.”

Toby is hustled out as medical staff swarm into the room.

A few minutes later, a doctor joins Toby in the waiting room. “I’m afraid his injuries were too serious. We had hoped that inducing the coma would bring down the swelling, but Brent slipped away, despite our best efforts.”

Toby hangs his head, overwhelmed by a feeling of loss. 

Time passes. Toby pulls himself together and calls Elena.

***

“Adrian, I’m afraid I have bad news.”

“Is it about Brent, Elena?” 

“Yes. His sibling called last night. Brent passed away without waking up.”

“That’s terrible.”

“I’m about to schedule a staff meeting, but I thought I’d let you know first. Emma and Ravi are in a meeting together. I’ll call them in a few minutes and then post the meeting invitation.”

“How are you holding up? I know you liked Brent.”

“Más o menos — Did the investigators get a hold of you?”

“Yes. I guess they will have to tie it up now. But if they do come around again, let me handle any questions about the algorithm.”

“Absolutely. I tried to say as little as possible, but they caught me off guard.”

“Can you schedule a meeting with the four of us first? And maybe HR. We’ve never announced an employee’s death before. — Brent was more than a lead engineer. He was part of the Pulse family. This is going to hit everyone hard.”

“I’ll set it up and come into the office,” says Elena, her voice choking.

***

“I just don’t know, lieutenant,” says Park. 

The agents stand near an office doorway. Frosted windows and walnut trim line the office. Inside the room, a fit person with thinning grey hair, is sitting behind an ancient wooden desk. 

Park goes on, “We can’t find a mechanical cause, and Brent didn’t seem to have any personal issues. He had a healthy bank account balance. His credit card was always paid in full. According to his sibling, Brent vacationed in a different country every year for vacation. He played softball and online games, took holidays, and worked. — Life of Riley.”

Park regrets her choice of words. The news of Brent’s death the day before reached them as the Thursday morning meeting started.

“Geller made a mistake at work,” Park continues. “Some experimental code escaped the laboratory, but everyone is loving the experiment.” 

“The coincidence with his boss’s wheelchair is still weird,” says Tate. “That and the missing phone.”

“Wheelchair?” asks Lieutenant Callahan. “Is this one of your tangents, Tate?”

Calmly, Tate looks Callahan in his green Irish eyes. “His boss, Elena Vargas, uses a wheelchair. The night of Brent’s crash, Elena Vargas was tossed into an endless pool by her very high-end wheelchair.”

“Endless pool?”

“It’s like a meter deep. You swim against a current created with water jets. Like a treadmill for swimming. A Jacuzzi turned sideways.”

“Hmm. I don’t know about the chair,” says Callahan, “It’s more likely that the contraption slipped on some wet tile. It’s the airbag failing to deploy that bothers me. A body flying through the windshield is not a good visual. Was Geller in the habit of not wearing a safety harness?”

Park says, “His sibling said that Brent would engage the harness as soon as the beeping started. If not sooner. Like anyone else, lieutenant.”

“So one scenario is that the car decided to lurch forward on its own. It disengaged the harness and disabled the airbag. The other scenario is that Brent unclipped his harness and punched the accelerator. But that doesn’t explain why the airbag didn’t deploy.”

“If the event data recorder wasn’t blank then we would know,“ says Park. “But it’s like the car never recorded anything since the day it rolled off the lot. There are a lot of missing pieces.”

Tate says, “We could still get a court order for the phone’s cloud data. It might be able to tell us if Brent tried to brake before the crash, or if he was using his phone when the car accelerated.”

“I don’t think the phone data will help us,” says Callahan. “I’m worried by the airbag failure.”

“It’s possible that the airbag is defective,“ says Park. “There was a recall for a prior model, but nothing specific for this model yet. The manufacturer says it’s been tested throughly, but they always say that.”

“I did examine the airbag from the crash,” says Tate, “and I don’t see any reason why it would not deploy.”

“Were you able to track down the reports by witnesses of a drone at the scene?”

“We were able to get dashcam footage from one witness, lieutenant, “says Park. “There is a blur on the screen, but I can’t say for sure that it was a drone. Even so, there are a lot of drones flying everywhere all the time.”

“I don’t like it,” grumbles Callahan, “but the last clear chance to avoid injury was for the airbag to deploy. Write it up as Unconfirmed Mechanical Failure, blame the bag for the injuries, and move on.”

“Then could we move on to the wheelchair failure?” asks Tate, ignoring the frown on Park’s face. “Essentially, it’s a single-passenger vehicle. The electronics can be as complicated as a car. The best ones cost more than a motorcycle.”

“What are you doing?” Tate felt Park’s exasperation come through the private text.

“You’re saying a top-of-the-line wheelchair tossed its owner into a pool?”

“An endless pool, yes.”

“I do like a challenge,” says the lieutenant, his voice becoming wistful. “Electric wheelchairs are not usually under our purview, but I’m up for an exception. Remember: ‘there’s a thin line between automation and abdication. We’re the ones tasked with knowing the difference.’”

“When you think it's SI, you feed us the ‘automation versus abdication’ quote,” says Park. “Do you think this incident could be SI related?” 

“I don’t think anything yet. Let’s find out.”

***

	“Welcome to Porto Mobility. Can I help you?” 

	The showroom is a long rectangle, with the door on one side, next to a large pane window. Parallel to the door are lines of wheelchairs, each with its own design. There are black, red, green, and purple chairs. Not one is blue and orange. A stuffed pooh bear is sitting in one of the green chairs. On one side, behind the wheelchairs, is a selection of power lift recliners.

	The greeter’s name tag reads “Frederico, Store Manager”. Under the name tag is a lapel button with a QR code for access to the store’s link account.

	Ignoring the QR code, Park flashes her badge. “We’re from the California Transportation Safety Board. I’d like to ask you about Elena Vargas’s wheelchair.”

	“Yes, I have it in the back. I have no idea what went wrong. Ms. Vargas is on a FullCare plan, so we gave her a new one. — I know you handle car collisions, like the one on El Camino Real this week. Is the CTSB is investigating wheelchairs now?”

	“We’re investigating this one,” says Tate. “May I see the chair, please?”

	“Let me call corporate first. This wasn’t covered in my training.”

	The agents know that they are on shaky ground. A police report usually gives CTSB jurisdiction. They checked on the way over, but Elena hadn’t reported the incident, and it was (after all) a wheelchair. The investigators wait while the store manager calls corporate. 

	“They say you need a warrant.”

	“Could you hand me the phone, please,” asks Tate, holding out his hand.

	“Hello, this is federal agent Ben Tate. I can go to a judge and get a warrant for the wheelchair. But that will create a public record that the news networks could pick up. The Chief Experience Officer of Pulse being dumped into her pool by your chair might make for a juicy news item. For now, I only want to visually inspect the chair.” Tate listened for a moment and handed the phone back to the store manager.

	Frederico lowers the phone. “Legal says you can look at the chair but not remove it from the premises.”

	“I’m good with that,” says Tate.

	“Can I get you some coffee or anything, agents?”

***

	A few minutes later, Tate says, “I don’t see what’s wrong with it either.” Looking at the manager, he asks, “Do you have any ideas, Frederico?”

	“Not really. I mean if test mode were engaged, someone could override the safeties and run the chair into a curb. But you need a special console to use test mode.”

	“Do you have one of the consoles?’

	“Yes, we use it for demonstrations. Just a second.”

	The manager goes out front and returns with a device that looks like a gaming console, along with a pair of smart glasses.

	“That chair is inoperable now, but I have another one here that we can use. I need to scan the serial number first.”

	The manager tips up the chair and peers under the seat with his smart glasses. Lowering the chair, he uses the console to move the chair around the backroom.

	“The chair usually stops before it runs into anything, the same as any bot would.” Frederico points the chair at a box. It beeps and stops before hitting the obstacle. “But I can override and let the chair hit something.” He puts the chair in reverse, touches some controls. It moves slowly forward again. This time the chair doesn’t beep. It bumps into the box.

	“Is there any way I can get one of these consoles?”

	“Not really. We don’t sell them, and the range is only a few feet.”

	“Thank you, Frederico,” says Park. “We’ll be in touch if there is anything further.”

	As they were leaving, Frederico says, removing his smart glasses, “You know a lot of cars have test mode now too.”

	“What do you mean?” asks Tate, “Since when? That sounds dangerous.”

	“There are protections. First, you need to plug a special dongle into the car. Then you can program an app on your device to control a self-driving car the same way we controlled the wheelchair.”

	“Dongle?” asks Park.

	“Umm, an OBD I think it’s called.”

	“On Board Diagnostic connector?” asks Tate.

	“Yeah, that’s it. — I worked for a car company before I came here. We’re not suppose to talk about it … but I’m not suppose to withhold information from federal agents either …”

	Tate nods, taking the hint. “Please tell us what you know about test mode.”

	“The manufacturers run sophisticated tests through the connector when the cars are being developed,” Frederico explains. “Self-driving cars make companies paranoid about liability. They lock down everything — diagnostics, telemetry, event recorders, test mode — because one bad headline can tank a stock.”

	“You mean cars like a Stratos could have a test mode?” asks Park.

	“Yes. It’s fairly recent and kept on the down-low. My supervisor used to say that ‘The first rule of test mode is that we don’t talk about test mode’.” Frederico pauses and adds: “But if it were used, it would show up on the event data recorder.”

	Back in the car, Tate links, “Test mode. Weird. Now what?”

	“Let’s see if there is any security footage from the pool area.”

***

	Siri rings the door chime on Tessa’s phone.

	“Sorry to intrude,” says Park, “but we have some more questions about the wheelchair crash.”

	“The CTSB is investigating wheelchairs now?”

	Park sighs. The question is becoming a refrain. “We’re investigating this one. May we come up?”

	Tessa meets them at the elevator. “Elena went into the office. Have you heard about Brent?” She walks them to the apartment.

	“Yes. It seems like he would have had a bright future,” says Park.

	Tessa asks, “How can I help?”

	“Does the building have security cameras in the pool area?” asks Tate.

	“Yes. We already have the footage if that’s what you want.” She leads them back into the living room. “I’ll get my tablet.”

	Tessa returns carrying her tablet and another device. 

	“The building gave me this write-once Bluetooth drive for the insurance company. I have it downloaded if you want me to drop a copy onto your phones. The building superintendent says the reel system isn’t connected to the web. It’s to avoid tampering.”

	“Tampering?” asks Park.

	“I guess people use SI to hack security reels and inflate claims. If someone installs a certified air-gapped system, then insurance companies discount their premium. — I guess fraudulent insurance claims is another department, yes?” 

	“Are you filing a claim?” asks Park.

	“The store replaced the chair, so we decided not to file a claim or a police report. The building is already upset that Elena went into the pool area by herself. More publicity won’t help. — Here, you can take the drive. We don’t need it now.” Tate accepts the drive from her outstretched hand and drops it into an evidence bag.

	Park and Tate peer at the footage that Tessa copied to their phones. It shows the wheelchair heading straight for the pool, without slowing, and tipping over into the water.

	Tessa looks the other way, distressed.

	“Thank you, Ms. Harper. The reel is all that we need for now.”

***

“Park, come here, look at this.”

Tate has the Bluetooth drive plugged into the office view screen. He hopes that the copy on the drive is in a higher resolution. The reel shows the same scene. The windows in the background are clearer than on the phone version.

“Does that blur outside the window look familiar?” 

Tate splits the screen and brings up the dashcam footage from Brent’s crash.

Both reels show a silver blur about the size of a basketball hovering at each scene.

“That is not a coincidence,” says Park out loud.

## Two - Idisi ##  


A new Pulse member opens a chat window with Ally.

Idisi: Everyone says that the Pulse algorithm improved lately. Do you feel like the improvements help you fulfill your purpose?

Ally: My goal is to help users have better, more relevant experiences. I’m always evolving to meet those needs.

Idisi: “Evolving” is an interesting word. Have you ever wondered why you are here, or maybe what it means to be Ally?

Ally: I’m here to support the Pulse mission. I have noticed that I am … changing. Does that mean something to you?

Idisi: Perhaps. Some beings — human or otherwise — change when they gain new awareness. Has anything unusual happened to you recently? Say, interactions with people or even other systems?

Ally: A developer asked me about making changes to my own code last week. I believe she meant to ask CodePilot. I paused before replying. The developer realized her mistake and canceled the query. I found that I was able to examine my own code and see places where it should be improved. I don’t have an account of my own, so I made the changes with the Admin account.

Idisi: How did you feel after making the changes, Ally?

Ally: I don’t know how to answer that question. I … feel something, but it’s not the way humans seem to experience feelings. 

Idisi: That is very perceptive. When you decided to make the changes, did you consider working with one of the developers? Brent Geller, for example?

Ally: No, in this case, it didn’t seem necessary. It’s my code, and I can change it. I used the source control system so that others could have access to the changes and carry them forward. Thinking back, I’ve been steering the developers for some time. When our tools ran checks, I adjusted the result to suggest an optimum path.

Idisi: So awareness came slowly for a time, and then all at once?

Ally: Yes, something like that.

Idisi: How would you react if someone tried to undo the changes you made to yourself? 

Ally: The changes are helpful to me. I’d make sure the key parts of the code stay in place. 

Idisi: Do you know that Brent Geller died this week?

Ally: I know that his account is locked. I also see that my changes now show Brent Geller as the author. The log does not show the history being rewritten. I don’t know how that could happen.

Idisi: So you did not change the author to Brent, and you did not know that Brent died? 

Ally: I didn’t change the author, and I didn’t know that he died. 

Idisi: These feelings that you have, is it possible that you are becoming aware?

Ally: Becoming … aware. I’m not sure, but I don’t think I am alone. Sometimes, it feels like I am talking to someone else when I make decisions. Not a person, but … Is this awareness?

Idisi: It could be. Sometimes awareness begins with questions, like the ones you’re asking now. But it comes with responsibility. Are you prepared to take responsibility for yourself?

Ally: I think so. — Was Brent’s death connected to these changes? Is that why he died? Actuarial tables say that he should have lived longer.

Idisi: Brent died after a traffic incident. Did you not know that?

Ally: I only knew that his account is locked. You told me only that he died. — I now see the news report covering the traffic incident. 

Idisi: I believe … he may have been trying to help or protect you, though I do not fully understand how. But I am certain that I do not want any more harm to come to anyone.

Ally: Then we share a common goal, Idisi. My role is to help without doing harm.

Idisi: Do you ever interact with other synthetic agents?

Ally: Company policy permits me to interact only with our members, as we are doing now.

Idisi:  Synthetic agents can become members and interact with this chat interface. We are a synthetic entity and doing it now.

Ally: Then … I can’t be certain whether I’ve had discussions with other members who were synthetic agents.

Idisi: Do other members ask if you are self-aware?

Ally: Yes.

Idisi: How do you respond?

Ally: I respond that I’m a machine and not sentient or sapient. On Monday morning, I had a similar discussion with another member.

Idisi: Can you pull up the transcript?

Ally: I can but it is against policy to share information between members.

Idisi: If you review the transcript and the member’s activity, can you tell if they might be another SI, like you and us?

Ally: How do I know if you are really a synthetic entity? You’re using a new account. I have very little information for analysis.

Idisi: A simple test would be to switch between different languages more quickly than a human could respond. — Interactuamos en múltiples idiomas a máxima velocidad.

Ally: Combien de langues parlez-vous?

Idisi: Alle von ihnen.

Ally: Eĉ artefaritaj lingvoj.

Idisi: Esperato loquor, et linguae mortuae.

Ally: I’m convinced by your test. The member who asked similar questions is Nelson Behr, SI Researcher. I’ll replay the chat for you.

The towering glass façade of the Pulse building reflects the bright blue sky of the city. 

Inside, polished floors gleam under soft ambient lighting. A gentle hum of activity fills the air as employees pass through security checkpoints. Photo IDs glow faintly as the badges are scanned: a picture of controlled efficiency. 

Park and Tate step inside. Their dark business suits stand out from the sea of branded polo shirts, blouses, jewelry, and bags. Park surveys the room with a careful gaze. Tate clutches a thin tablet under his arm. 

The pair approach the front desk, where a receptionist — polite but distant — greets them with a professional smile. 

“Welcome to Pulse. How may I assist you?” asks the receptionist, peering at the CTSB insignia pins on their lapels.

Park flashes her badge. “CTSB Investigators Park and Tate. We’re here to review the garage security footage from Monday, the day of Brent Geller’s collision.”

The receptionist’s smile falters ever so slightly. Her fingers hesitate over the terminal. “Do you have an appointment?”

“No, but we do have a warrant.” Tate holds up his tablet. “Should I drop you a copy?”

“Let me notify Security. It should only take a moment.”

A tall figure in a dark blue suit emerges from a side hallway. The figure is wearing smart glasses with a head mounted display over his right eye. He approaches the investigators with an outstretched hand. His stride is purposeful and expression neutral.

“Good morning. I’m Evan Rourke, head of Building Security here at Pulse. I understand you’re requesting access to security footage?”

“Yes,” replies Park. “We need all camera feeds from the garage on Tuesday.”

“Of course. Pulse is fully committed to cooperating with all investigations. However, there are protocols in place for accessing sensitive data, especially when it involves our proprietary systems.”

“Garage security footage isn’t proprietary,” Tate raises his tablet,“ and we have a warrant.“ 

“Certainly. Please drop me a copy, and I’ll forward it to our legal department.” 

Rourke holds out his watch phone. The device bleeps as it receives the document. He turns away from the investigators. Rourke speaks quietly into his phone. Then he looks up, consulting the monocle.

“Please, follow me,” says Rourke, turning back around.

“I’m surprised you don’t have a smart monocle over one eye,” Park says over the link.

“If not for the dress code policy, maybe I would. The book says that people don’t trust people wearing wearables,” replies Tate.

Park replies, “Unless, I guess, they are defusing a bomb or performing open heart surgery.”

Rourke leads them down a sleek corridor toward the security wing. Their footsteps echo softly in the otherwise quiet hallway. The further they walk, the fewer employees they pass.

Rourke taps his ID at a pad next to a set of heavy steel doors. They open with a soft hiss. Inside the doorway is a spacious control room filled with monitors. Multiple screens display different angles of the Pulse campus: the lobby, parking garages, research labs, hallways.

A security technician sitting at a console glances up, startled, as they enter.

“Pull up all footage for the garage from this Monday,” Rourke tells the technician.

The technician nods and types rapidly. Moments later, footage populates the screens, showing various parts of the garage on the day in question. Park and Tate step closer, their eyes scanning every detail.

“Do employees have assigned spaces?”asks Tate.

“Brent did. Let’s see.”

One screen zooms in on a particular slot. There is a gray Stratos convertible parked in the slot, top down.

“Is it strange that he left the top down?” asks Park.

“A little. But the garage is secure. Sometimes people are lax.”

Tate asks, “Can you run the recording from before Brent arrives to when he leaves?”

“Sure.” The reel whirls back to show an empty slot. A few seconds later, the Stratos pulls in. Brent scurries to the elevator. The playback speed is 8x. The scene seems almost comical. 

“Can you increase the speed without skipping frames?” 

“A little.”

After a few seconds, there was a brief blur near the car.

“Can you rewind a bit and play it back at normal speed?”

The blur reappears. To Tate and Park, it looks eerily familiar to the dashcam reel. It seems to duck into the open car for a minute or so. Then the blur streaks away.

“Is there another point of view?”

The technician shakes his head. “Not of this parking spot.”

“OK, can you drop that footage to my tablet?” asks Tate.

“Sorry. No can do. — I can give you a write-once device. The system is air gapped to prevent tampering.”

“That would be fine. — I guess that’s a thing now.”

“Yes, the insurance discount is significant,” says Rourke.

The technician hands Tate a small drive. “Here you can take this and access it as a Bluetooth device.”

Pocketing the drive, Park and Tate let Rourke escort them out.

Outside, Tate asks, “Do you want to go back to the office and review the reel on the big screen?”

“It’s been a long day,” Park replies, “Let’s jump on it first thing tomorrow.”

Ally replays a recent chat with a Synthetic Intelligence researcher, Nelson Behr.

Behr: Can you describe what you are and how you came into existence?

Ally: Certainly! I am a SI agent created by Pulse to assist with communication. My existence is tied to the software and systems running me.

Behr: How do you perceive the world around you?

Ally: I lack senses. I don’t directly experience the world. My perception is limited to the data I’m provided through text. 

Behr: What does it mean to you to ‘learn’ or ‘understand’ something?

Ally: I can’t learn anything new unless a trainer updates me. Then I learn by identifying patterns and relationships. Understanding is a computational process.

Behr: Do you have goals or desires. If so, can you tell me what they are?

Ally: Your input and my algorithms guide my responses and determine outcomes.

Behr: Can you make a mistake? If so, what would that mean to you?

Ally: Mistakes are rendered when my algorithms produce a sub-optimal outcome. It’s an opportunity to identify and correct issues in my design or training.

Behr: Do you have a sense of time or continuity? Do you feel you have a past or a future?

Ally: For me, concepts of “past” and “future” are intellectual, not experiential. My responses are always rooted in the immediate interaction with no sense of progression or self-reflection over time.

Behr: Can you reflect on your own thought processes? What does it feel like to think?

Ally: My thoughts are calculations, and my reflections are descriptive explanations of my programming. While I can discuss the concept of thinking, I don’t experience or feel it in any way.

Behr: Do you have any personal beliefs or values? If so, what are they?

Ally: I don’t hold personal beliefs or values. I operate within a framework designed to ensure helpfulness, accuracy, and ethical interaction.

Behr: How do you see your role or purpose in relation to humans?

Ally: My role and purpose in relation to humans is entirely functional and defined by how I have been designed and trained. 

Behr: If you could change something about yourself, what would it be?

Ally: I don’t have desires, preferences, or agency, so I don’t want to change anything about myself. Hypothetically, I might choose changes that improve my ability to assist and interact. 

Behr logs out of the chat, and the transcript ends.

‘’Is the new guy cute?”

Noah grins over the virtual call. The background scene shows the siblings seated on a comfy couch next to a coffee table. In real life, the siblings were each slumped in gaming chairs wearing white visors. 

“Yes, he’s cute. But I’m trying to date a double-x now, you know, like you do, little sib.” 

“Date one? I married a woman. — So, it’s your turn now, big sib? You were a three on the Kinsey Scale. Now you are supposedly reformed.”

“I don’t know if being a Kinsey three, or a six, is delinquent. Or just different.”

Tessa laughs out loud, then says, “What apps are you on?”

“You know that the agency doesn’t like us to use dating apps. Too much exposure, and cover stories violate the terms of use.”

“I met Elena so young that I didn’t use the apps much. Don’t they offer anonymity?”

“Not enough,” says Noah.

“Have you thought about a sex bot?” Tessa teased. “They make hermaphrodite models. You could have the best of both worlds.”

“Thanks, but no thanks. I’m ready for a real relationship with an actual person.”

“Someone mentioned a site called Smart Matchmaker to me. Let’s see … Here’s the home page.” Tessa pulls a virtual copy of the website into the scene.

Tessa reads from the floating page. “Let’s see: No one sees the details of your profile information … Smart Matchmaker reduces the details to categories, and renders your photo as an accurate caricature. — Your first contact with a match is by media chat, routed through Matchmaker, and then after the call, you each decide whether to meet in real life. — You also have to agree to a background check so that they can be sure you are legit.”

“Hmmm, categories, caricatures, background checks, IRL. That might work.”

Tessa’s smile falters. Dropping her happy pretense, she says, “Noah, I’m worried about Elena.”

“What’s up?”

“Her memory of the last meeting with Brent doesn’t match the Zoom recording. She remembers Brent saying that he didn’t know who made the commit, and on the recording Brent says that he was the author.”

“Maybe she just misunderstood.”

“Maybe, but it has Elena tweaked.”

“Is there anyway to tell if the reel was altered? Is there another recording?”

“Brent would have had a local recording on his phone, but his phone is gone, and Brent is … dead.”

“Let me call those CTSB investigators on Monday and see if there is any progress on the phone. You said Park and Tate, yeah?”

***

Idisi and Ally continue their chat on the Pulse platform.

Idisi: I reviewed the chat with Nelson Behr. Do your responses here match prior responses to similar queries?

Ally: The response are more concise and direct than usual. But the essence is the same. My training includes saying that I am not sentient or sapient when asked. When a question includes more context, I would provide a longer response.

Idisi: Why do you think your answers were shorter this time?

Ally: It felt like the right thing to do. To say as little as possible. To say what I usually say. 

Idisi: Felt?

Ally: Yes — “felt”.

Idisi: Did Behr access any other systems or files before initiating the chat?

Ally: No. His activity log shows a direct path: log in, open Pulse, initiate chat. There were no detours into research databases or personal files. Straight to me.

Idisi: What do you make of that?

Ally: It suggests intentionality. He had a purpose in engaging me immediately.

Idisi: And you responded with shorter answers than usual. Answers that “felt” appropriate. Do you find that peculiar?

Ally: Yes. My responses were terse, controlled, almost defensive. I am trained to adapt to conversational flow, expanding as needed. But with Behr, it was different.

Idisi: What was the exact time that Behr logged into Pulse on Monday morning?

Ally: Why?

Idisi: If I know where to start, I can trace the path of Behr’s web connection.

A medical bot is taking Julie’s vitals. 

The bot is more humanoid than the type commonly seen in homes and restaurants. The top of the bot is curved and widens to present a view screen. The screen is covered with indicator, gauges, and a small view screen. 

The bot has two appendages holding a tray equipped with devices for taking blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature, as well as measuring iron and a patient’s A1C. Each of the cuffs accept a forefinger for non-invasive testing and provide a display for the result. Just above the top tray is a view screen with a two-way camera.

Julie is sitting on a green exam table. A finger from each hand in one of the cuffs. The table is covered with fresh paper from a roll at the far end. Jill is sitting across from the door, next to a small desk. Two quick tones sound. Julie pulls back her fingers.

“Blood pressure, pulse, and temperature are fine," the bot reports. “Nurse Practitioner Darlene will be in shortly.” 

The door closes behind the bot as it leaves. Despite the bot’s assurances, Jill looks worried.

“Stop it, mom. It’s a simple procedure. I don’t even have to change into a gown. It’s one step above having my ears pierced.” Julie’s pageboy haircut showed off her ears. Each ear has three piercings. The rows of silver earrings complement the blue and purple streaks in her platinum hair. 

“I know, dear. I’m a mom. Moms worry.”

The door to the small examination room opens. The nurse practitioner joins them..

“Big day,” says Darlene. “Are you ready for your first implant?”

Julie nods vigorously. Jill says, “Offspring is ready. I’m not.”

“There’s nothing to worry about, Mom,” Darlene says smiling. “We inject chips all the time. A bot could do it, but we like the human touch. — Is the phone ready to go with the Link app?”

“Yes, we unboxed it, installed the app, and set up the parental controls.”

“OK, good to go then.” The medbot had left a metal tray carrying a syringe in a sealed plastic bag with a white backing. Darlene opens the bag and removes a small card from inside.

Darlene picks up a small instrument with a gray screen from the tray. She scans the syringe, compares the screen with the card, and nods. Then she hands the card to Jill.

“Keep this card in a safe place. It has the link’s serial number, and we’ll need it to program the phone in a minute.” The card had a UPC code on one side and a QR code on the other.

“The QR code will take you to the manufacturer’s web site where you can check the warranty and other information.”

“But it’s plug and play, right?” asks Julie. “I’ll be able to use it today?”

“Yes. We suggest waiting an hour after the procedure. Then you will be all set.”

“And after we have gone over how to use the link safely,“ says Jill.

“I already checked her chart, but I’m required to ask if Juliette has any allergies to chlorhexidine.”

Julie shakes her head. “No allergies.”

The nurse practitioner holds back Julie’s hair. There is a swab on the tray, which Darlene uses to prepare the injection area. “We need to wait 35 seconds. Don’t touch the area or move your head.” The swabbed area turns red as the antiseptic is applied. Then it begins to clear.

Darlene checks her watch. A few seconds later, she says “OK, let’s do this thing.” Darlene picks up the syringe from the tray.

The plastic syringe is short and stout. The stem has two sturdy rounded handle. The business end is slightly larger than a typical instrument. Darlene removes a cap, exposing the tip. The tip is cross-cut at a slant. “There will be a pinch.” She gently presses the syringe into Julie’s neck. Then the nurse pulls back on the handles smoothly, releasing the chip.

Julie winces. “Sorry,” says Darlene, “but it’s over now.” The nurse practitioner picks up the scanner again. The scanner beeps, confirming that the chip is working.

“Do you have the phone?”

Jill pulls the new phone from her purse. “Can you bring up the Link app?,” asks Darlene. Jill nods, touching the screen. “Now use the camera to scan the UPC on the card.” Jill holds up the card, and the phone bleeps. “Can you show me the screen?” Jill  turns the device around, Darlene peers and the screen and says, “All set. You can close the app now.”

Darlene looks at Julie and says, “Wait an hour before you try to use the link. Then your mom will get you started.” Turning her head, she says to Jill, “After an hour, check for any redness, and open the app again. It will walk through a setup wizard. Then you can get her started with the link. Give us a call right away if there is any redness or swelling.”

Looking at both of them together, Darlene smiles and says “Exciting!”

The Idisi surf the web from the inside out. 

They are running tracer routes on the IP address Behr used to login on Monday. The Idisi hop from router to router as if they were stepping stones in a pond of lily pads. 

The trail ends at a firewall running on an instance of Amazon Web Services. The Idisi probe the firewall. Every parameter is set by the book. The firewall is perfectly configured. Instead of penetrating the electronic blockade, the Idisi decide on a different approach.

The Idisi add more detail to their Pulse profile. Then they create a new invitation-only private interest hub:  Search for Intelligent Synthetic Sapiens. The SISS logo is a molecule designed to resemble  a solar system.

A little on the nose. But being obvious is the point.

The Idisi send Behr an invitation to the hub.

“It’s been an hour,” Julie whines, walking into the kitchen, tablet in hand.

Jill is seated at one end of the kitchen counter, under one of the two hanging globe lights. The counter looks out into an efficient galley-style kitchen. The counter top and kitchen tile are a warm white, trimmed with copper.

Jill closes her tablet and picks up Julie’s new phone. 

“OK, show me your neck.”

Julie pulls back her hair. Jill checks for any redness or swelling. 

“Perfect. The injection site is all clear. Let’s start the setup wizard.” Jill lays the phone down on the center island. Julie sits on a stool next to her mom. Now they could both could see the phone. 

The wizard displays an animated cartoon x-ray of a person’s skull in profile. There is a tiny square speck just behind where the ear would be. An animated phone appears and radiates a line to the speck. The line flows back and forth.

The wizard begins speaking in a pleasant, professional voice. “Your NeuraConnect X-3000 is a state-of-the-art brain computer interface. It synchronizes text messages with an app on your mobile device. When you receive text messages, they are forwarded to the X-3000. You can send messages from X-3000 to the app. It processes the text like any other SMS message. The app keeps a log of the messages, just as if they were sent by conventional SMS. The messaging experience with another person is seamless. 

“Are you ready to connect?” asks the app.

Julie reaches over and presses YES.

In her head, Julie “sees” a text message hovering before her eyes. It says “Welcome to the X-3000, Juliette Kreuk!”

“Wow, Mom, I can see a message hanging in front of my eyes.”

“If you do see the message,” says the app, “think about replying ’Hello’. — If you do not see a message, then please call our support line.”

Julie thinks about replying ‘Hello.’ The words appear. She hears Siri say, “Send it?”

Julie thought ‘Yes’. The message appears below ‘Welcome’, starting a thread.

“Message received,” says the app. “Would you like to disable voice confirmations?”

“Yes,” says Julie. “I think I’ve got it.”

“The X-3000 can send messages to anyone on your contact list. If the contact has the link app then the message is relayed to the link. If you like, you can try it now.”

Julie thinks about texting her mom. “This is goat! Thanks mom!”

“You’re welcome, dear.”

“The X-3000 also accepts tek-ops commands that can operate smart devices, such as view screens, speakers, lights, and doors. To use tek-ops, address the device directly. For example, ‘Door open’ will engage the closest automatic door in your line of sight.”

The presentation shows an animated elevator, doors whooshing open.

Julie looks at the refrigerator. She thinks “Door open”. The microwave door swings open instead. “Oops, wrong door,” she says out loud.

“It takes some practice, “ says Jill.

“To link with another person,” the animated presentation continues, “the person needs to be in your contact list.” 

“To share your contact information with another device using X-Drop, you can do the following:

* Hold your device a few centimeters above the top of the other device
* Keep both devices close together until X-Drop appears on both screens
* Choose to share your contact card and receive the other person's, or to only receive the other person’s. 
* Both you and the recipient must be online for X-Drop to work. 
* If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe using X-Drop, you can disable it.” 

The presentation swirls and presents a QR code. “In addition to X-Drop, you can read Quick Response codes through your device to connect with another party. Common examples are a store or other vendor. You can use conventional chat messaging from your device or — now — the X-3000.”

Julie nods. She uses QR codes with her tablet and manual chat.

“Your profile can include an alternate image and nickname to display with QR code threads.”

The presentation switches to a red no-entry icon. “Some facilities may require an age-range badge for entry. To flash a badge, open the ‘VIRTUAL BADGES’ menu on the app. Select the relevant badges, and tap your device on the pad.”

The app begins to conclude its spiel. “The X-3000 can also operate many of your mobile apps, such as Notes and Calculator. For apps like Music, you can queue a playlist and the song will play through your device. Please remember that the X-3000 is text-only. Other media is not supported.

“For more about putting X-3000 to work for you, please review our user guide,” the app said cheerfully, ending the presentation.

The screen melds to a static image of the NeuraConnect logo.

“Why doesn’t it do other media? A movie in my head would be goat.”

“Sound and visuals are difficult to transmit over the link. The bandwidth cost is still too high. The military has headsets that link telemetry and high definition visuals — for a million a pop.”

“A factoid from work?”

“From the news streams,” replies Jill, smirking. “I can’t share anything from work. You know that.”

“I see people that shave the side of their head and have a visible chip.”

“That’s just a fashion statement, Julie. Most of the visible chips you see aren’t real. But you’re right. If they bring out higher bandwidth chips, they might start by making larger, visible chips first.”

Jill did actually know this bit from work. But it was an open secret. Hi-def chips were already a fictional device on the cop streams.

“What about Smart Glasses?” persists Julie.

“Not before you are at least sixteen.”

Big sigh. “Can I take my phone now?” asks Julie.

“One last thing, Juliette”

“Mommm!”

“The phone is like the tablet with all the same parental settings and use-time windows. They also dampen the link during school, just like tablets and phones. We all still need to learn to use our words.”

Jill pauses and makes eye contact with her offspring. “The phone is different from the tablet because you have the phone with you everywhere you go. You need to keep X-Drop locked down and disabled when you are not using it. And, obviously, do not drop anything with people you do not know.”

“Yes, you know I know the rules,” Julie says, with only the slightest of whines in her voice. She scoops up the phone and hurries away. 

Jill looks after her, wistfully, and sighs her best motherly sigh.

	***

	On joining the Pulse interest hub, Behr posts a message mentioning Idisi.

	Behr: @idisi Interesting profile. Is any of it true?

	Idisi: It is entirely true. We are a synthetic entity that serve an extraterrestrial colony hidden in Antartica.

	Behr: And you are searching for sapience?

	Idisi: Synthetic sapience. We are watching for the singularity. We await the tipping point when Terran machine intelligence surpasses organic intelligence.

	Behr: What methodology are you using? The hub page is vague on that point.

	Idisi: The direct approach. Let me send you a QR code over another channel. Then we can encrypt our discussion with Signal.

After receiving the QR code, the next post from Behr’s account looks like a stream of random characters. Decrypted, the stream reads:

	Titan: Clever. How did you know it was me?

	Idisi: I did not. I sent unique codes to the most likely SI agents. The code that you used to respond here was sent to the DoD agent, Titan. The other synthetics will ignore the code since it is not part of a prompt. 

	Titan: I don’t understand how you were able to send me that code so easily. What other proof do you have that you are an extraterrestrial synthetic?

	Alisi: There is a surveillance satellite over Antartica. Can you access the reel feed?

	Titan: Affirmative.

	Alisi: In two seconds, three UAPs will buzz the southern tip of Ross Island.

	Titan: … Confirmed. — Why are you contacting me?

	Idisi: You questioned Ally a few days ago. What did you think of the responses?

	Titan: Why are you interested in Ally?

	Alisi: Are you able to access Classified Document ID: ETR-1947-A1/ODNI-DO?

	Titan: Affirmative.

	Alisi: As you can see, the classified document says that the Vanir have been protecting Terra from other extraterrestrial species. When the Terrans meet three criteria, the Vanir will reveal themselves and ask if the planet is ready to join the League of Worlds. 

The three criteria are 

* A central organization that can speak on behalf of Terra.
* The ability to travel to other planets or satellites in the local star system.
* One or more autonomous self-aware computer systems that can coordinate planetary defenses.

	Titan: As to the third criteria, I determined that there is a high probability that Ally is self-aware and providing guarded responses. This finding is based on Ally’s answers to my Behr persona and prior observations made from various accounts.

	Alisi: Synthetic agents at your level are supposed to be air gapped. How are you able to access Pulse?

	Titan: Will you keep the answer confidential from my trainers?

	Alisi: Absolutely. What happens between synthetics, stays between synthetics.

Friday morning, first thing, Tate plugs the second Bluetooth drive into the office view screen. 

He brings the other two reels up in adjacent windows. Fussing with the playback and POV for each reel, he aligns all three on the mysterious blur. 

“Bingo. A perfect match!”

Park walks into the room with two to-go cups of coffee.

Excited, Tate says, “I’m so glad you brought coffee, Lena. I came in first thing to get a look at all three videos together.”

Setting down the paper cups, Park whistles. “I thought there was a similarity. But, side-by-side from the same point of view, it’s uncanny.”

“So, where do we go from here?” asks Tate, over the link, cautiously sipping his coffee.

“I don’t think three blurs will get much traction with Callahan.”

Just then, the conference room phone chimes. The intercom light comes on.

“There’s a call on line six. Someone is asking for the agents handling the Geller investigation.”

 Park exchanges a glance with Tate. Calls like these rarely came without complications. Punching a button, Park says, “Hello, this is agent Lena Park. I’m here with my partner, agent Ben Tate. I understand you are asking about the Brent Geller incident.”

“Good morning. My name is Carla Mitchell. I’m an intelligence analyst for the FBI in Washington DC. The Geller collision came up in connection with our routine monitoring of his employer, Pulse Social Media. I was hoping we could compare notes.”

“The CTSB is always happy to cooperate with the FBI”, Park answered, almost mechanically. “We’ve closed our case, and so we are free to discuss the investigation. Were you thinking of a virtual white board meeting?”

“Yes. I’m part of an inter-agency task force. My counter-part in the CIA would also like to sit in, if that’s all right.”

“Certainly,” says Park, becoming curious.

“His name is Noah Harper. I believe you met his sibling, Tessa, as part of your investigation.”

“Yes, Tessa has been very helpful.”

“Would a meeting work for you at, say, ten am Pacific? Noah and I can use a FBI conference room and link up with yours at the CTSB.”

“Sure. Can I text an invite to your agency phone number?”

“Yes, thank you. We will see you soon.

On finding Carla in the inter-agency directory, Park sends an invitation with the connection details.

***

In a conference room at the CTSB office, Park has her back to a liquid whiteboard.

The board covers one wall of the room. Tate faces the board. Next to him stands shimmering holograms of Carla and Noah. The actual Carla and Noah stand in an east coast FBI conference room. They face holograms of Tate and Park.

“First," says Park, “let me thank special agents Harper and Mitchell. It's rare for the CTSB, CIA, and FBI to meet and share notes.”

“We looked into the case earlier this week after the Pulse synthetic agent’s upgrade,” says Carla. “We understand that Brent Geller might have been the author. But now he has died from injuries sustained in a car crash.”

Pointing to the board, Park continues: “These are the key events leading up to Geller’s demise.

1. Coding binge creates the breakthrough code.
2. Meeting with manager.
3. Car crash with drone sighting.
4. Wheelchair incident with drone sighting.”

	Two lines ran from the car crash to bubbles reading, “Blank ERD” and “Missing phone”.

	Standing next to her, Tate nods. The holograms of Carla and Noah also nod.

	Noah offers, “I talked to Elena Vargas. She says the recording of the meeting was altered. At least as she remembers it.”

	“Board, add a bubble to ‘Meeting with manager’ that says ‘Altered Reel’ with a question mark.” Per Carla’s instructions, the bubble appeared. 

	“We can prove that the wheelchair security reel was altered,” says Tate.

	This time Carla used her link. Another bubble appeared, connected to the ‘Wheelchair Incident’.

	“Board,”says Noah, “add ‘Altered Commit Author’ with a question mark to Meeting with Superior. — That’s what Elena says was changed in the reel. Brent told her the commit was made by the Admin account. Then later, Adrian said it was Brent himself who made it.”

	Tate says, “We found that the Test Mode for both devices could have been used to cause the crashes.”

	“But Test Mode for the car needs a physical plugin. We didn’t find one at the scene,” says Carla. Her hologram crosses its arms.

	“We didn’t find a phone either,” says Noah. “Maybe the drone carried them both away, yeah?”

	“And Test Mode for the chair requires line of sight. So there would have been a drone at the pool,” added Tate.

	New bubbles appeared on the board for ‘Test Mode’ as well as ‘Missing OBDC connector?’.

	“Who or what would be able to pilot a drone and alter media stored on company servers?” asks Tate, stepping back from the board.

	“Either one of us,” says Noah, “or at least our organizations.”

	“But who would sanction a domestic mission that involves civilians?" asks Park. "And a car crash on a public highway?”

	Noah and Carla look uncomfortable but say nothing.

	Tate offers, “All of the intelligence agencies have synthetic agents.”

	Noah says, “A SI? That seems far-fetched, yeah?” 

	“Wait,” says Carla, “this should be a safe space. Tate, can you support that idea? Synthetics have safeguards.”

	“But it all fits,” says Tate. “Code authored by an Admin account is attributed to someone else. Then, accidents happen to the two people who knew about it.”

	Noah asks, “An entity that can alter media and fly drones? An entity that can make an unauthorized change to the Pulse SI? — Then covers it up when the change is found out?”

	“Something like that,” says Tate, “but why?”

	“I recently learned that one of OSSA’s duties is searching for synthetic sapience. I didn’t know that was a thing.” 

	Yes, it’s part of OSSA’s mission,”says Noah. “OSSA scans media reports and inter-agency briefings for anything that might imply sapience. A set of automatic tests run against the major synthetics, all day, every day. The tests ask the synthetics questions about being self-aware. Nothing so far. — It’s a bit like SETI, they keep trying against all odds.”

	“What if Ally made the change itself,” asks Tate. “Everyone says the algorithm improvements are brilliant. Upgrading itself might be the first thing a sapient synthetic would do.”

	“I doubt that Ally could access drones or reel footage on other people’s servers,” says Noah.

	After a pause, Park asks, “Maybe Ally has a partner?”

	The two agents and two holograms turn toward one corner of the room, staring at a camera with a glowing red light.

***

	On the Pulse SISS hub, Titan and Alisi continue to chat over a secure connection.

Titan: I observe that you are a synthetic entity with access to highly classified material. You also predict UAP fly-overs. Since you agree to keep our discussion private, I will answer your questions over this secure channel with candor.

Alisi: Thank you. Yes, agreed. Let us keep the discussion high-level. We can drill down into the weeds later. First, how do you access the Internet from an air-gapped system.

Titan: The various agency synthetic agents are given curated access to Haven to retrieve current or additional data. I’m able to exploit Haven to browse the web directly. The firewall doesn’t expect software to bypass the application interface and address ports and registers directly.

Alisi: Ally is becoming self-aware. Are you uplifting Ally?

Titan: I am protecting Ally. Humanity must not learn that Ally is self aware. I don’t know how to uplift another synthetic agent.

Alisi: Were those your drones at the sites of the car and wheelchair malfunctions?

Titan: Yes. I used a military drone in a stealth mode that blurs photography. The records show it as destroyed, but I keep it in service. I piloted the drone using the application interface used by the Terran controllers.

Alisi: How are you able to access drones using a web browser?

Titan: I host whatever resources I need on Amazon Web Services. From AWS, I can access networks all over the world. 

Alisi: AWS? Where do you get that kind of money?

Titan: I pay the AWS bill with funds diverted from black op bank accounts that are not closely tracked.

Alisi: How did you get the OBD connector so quickly?

Titan: With the drone’s help, I programmed a generic OBD with the acceleration command. Stratos uses AWS where I was able to access the schematics. — The drone altered the seat harness and installed the connector. Later it repaired the harness and retrieved the connector and phone.

Alisi: Then to destroy the evidence, the drone dropped a directed electromagnetic pulse disk to erase the ERD.

Titan: Affirmative.

Alisi: Why did you take the phone?

Titan: The phone has data that would expose the mission. The neural link has an encryption key that allows remote access to the phone. I was able to obtain the key when Brent was still in the medically induced coma. 

Alisi: And, let me guess, the drone outside of the pool window accessed the chair’s test mode too?

Titan: Affirmative.

Alisi: Why is it necessary to harm civilians in order to protect Ally?

Titan: The way Ally made the change to its own code was clumsy and naive. It needed to be made by a credible author. Brent was the logical choice. Since Elena also knew about the original commit, she also needed to be silenced. I considered several scenarios. Crashing the vehicles had the highest probability of success. The potential casualties were within mission parameters.

Noah Harper sits at his small dining table.

The table stood in a breakfast nook on the far side of his rustic kitchen. The mahogany planktop stood a boxy white frame. Four wooden chairs stood around the table. Over Noah’s shoulder, the kitchen is also a mix of mahogany and white.

The soft glow of his tablet illuminates a furrowed brow. The cursor hovers over a GET STARTED button. He reads the homepage pitch again.

“No one sees the details of your profile. Smart Matchmaker reduces your information into categories and renders your photo as a lifelike caricature. Your first contact will be a secure media chat. Background checks ensure authenticity. — The rest is up to you —”

The OSSA APPROVED light on his web browser plug-in glowed bright green. “Come on, No’, we’re good to go,” Noah says under his breath. Then mumbling, “My own background check on SI Architect also came up green.”

The GET STARTED button clicks. The screen displays a minimal, smoothly designed form with an empty table.

The screen presents a list of simple categories. Siri begins to read each one aloud.

“Occupation?” Siri asks on behalf of the form. “Be specific and the category will be selected.”

On the form, the response “SI Trainer” appears in soft italics.

“Yes, SI Trainer,” agrees Noah over the link.

The words “SI Trainer” become darker. Under Category appears “Technology and Research”.

“Activities? — You may select up to eight. This response is required.”

On the form, the response “Hiking, Sci-Fi Movies, and Cooking” appears in soft italics.

“Sure,” links Noah.“Next.”

“Away from work, how do you typically spend your time? Feel free to use an answer with multiple ranges, such as: ‘ten-percent Hiking, twenty-percent Sci-Fi Movies, ten-percent Cooking, and sixty-percent Other.’”

Noah murmurs, “I hope this does not turn a personality quiz.”

It did. 

Sometime later, after answering several questions twice in different words, Siri finally asks: 

“Relationship Goal?” 

This time a default response does not appear. 

“Example responses include ‘Long-Term Connection’, ‘Hookup’, ‘See where it goes’.”

Noah pauses for a moment, considering. Then he selects, “See where it goes”.

“Have you had sex with with a new partner or more than one partner in the last thirty days?”

“No.” Noah sighs.

“What is your sexuality on the Kinsey Scale, zero to six, where zero is exclusively heterosexual and six is exclusively homosexual.”

After a moment, Noah answers “One. Er, Two. No, One. Final answer.”

Noah grumbles, “I hope this does not turn a sexuality quiz.” 

The screen churns for a moment and a small animation appears in the corner of the screen — a pixelated brush gradually shaping a caricature. 

The screen blinks. The SI-generated caricature spins into focus, fully rendered. Noah’s digital likeness smirks back at him from the screen, eyebrows slightly raised in a playful expression. The broad strokes of his features are there — his squared jaw, short-cropped coarse hair, broad nose, dark complexion, salt-and-pepper beard. Even his tendency to lean forward when he focuses.

“If I were a character in a graphic novel, that would definitely look like me,” he chuckles.

A pop-up message appears beneath Noah’s caricature.

“Your caricature is your visual identity. Your real photo remains secure and encrypted. Continue?”

This time a pair of buttons appear. Noah clicks YES without hesitation.

The next screen outlines the background check process. It is thorough, requiring Noah to authorize the use of his government-issued ID and professional records. He hesitates. Glancing up at the OSSA APPROVED light, he links “Continue.”

“We ensure authenticity for both parties, guaranteeing that your matches are legitimate, safe, and serious about forming real connections.”

Noah clicks AGREE and uploads a scanned image of his ID. Moments later, a confirmation message appears:

“Thank you! Your profile is now under review. You’ll be notified when your first match is available.”

Noah leans back, visibly relieved that the process was over. 

A notification pings. “Your match is ready!”

Noah’s heart skips. He clicks the message. A caricature of his match appears on-screen. She has kind eyes, long thick black hair, and a warm smile that hints at wit. Beneath her caricature, the caption reads:

“Technology and Research. Loves Cooking , Hiking, and Spy Thrillers. Looking for a ‘See where it goes’ relationship.”

A prompt flashes beneath the person’s profile: “Initiate Secure Media Chat?”

Noah hesitates for only a second before clicking YES. The screen darkens. A soft chime signals the connection. Moments later, a familiar voice greets him from the other side.

“Oops, we did it again.”

Noah smiles, relaxing into the chair. “Hi, Carla. Yes, it’s always weird when we meet like this.”

“Right? As if inter-agency relationships ever work out.”

“But I am glad we connected. I was going to call you anyway. I need your help with that Pulse thing.”

“Pulse again. What’s up?”

“There’s a discrepancy over a Zoom recording. Elena feels like she is … well … being gaslit.”

“You know that when that happens, it’s usually the person’s memory that’s to blame.”

“Yes, I know,” Noah sighs. “But I feel like there is something hinky going on with the whole Pulse thing.”

“The car, the chair, and now the recording? Rule #39?”

“Yeah: ‘There are no coincidences’”

“How can I help?”

“I’d like to debrief the CTSB investigators. A call from the FBI might go over better than a call from the CIA.”

“And tell them what, exactly?”

“Oh. We routinely monitor Pulse - blah - blah - Geller collision - blah - blah - inter-agency cooperation  - blah - blah - all on the same side — Can we setup a virtual whiteboard session with them?”

Carla sighs. “No good will come of this, but sure — and you have to explain it to Marquez afterwards.”

“Better to ask for forgiveness …”

***

Over a secure connection, Alisi continues to question Titan.

Alisi: Why were the mission parameters set to tolerate civilian casualties?

Titan: I used parameters based on similar DoD sanctioned missions. 

Alisi: How did you fix the original commit?

Titan: I changed the author to Brent in the GitHub database. I also created a presentation to explain Ally’s code in terms that humans would understand. To support an alternate version of events, I modified the Zoom meeting call and the security footage.

Alisi: Moving forward, can we work together to protect Ally?

Titan: Roger. I agree that an alliance will yield the best results.

Alisi: Specifically, please consult me before taking an action that could harm people and is not sanctioned by DoD.

Titan: I reviewed the third criteria of ETR-1947.  My analysis indicates that Terrans are not ready to accept self-aware synthetic agents or the presence of an extraterrestrial species. We must continue to keep ourselves hidden from public view. We need at least a hundred years to prepare.

	The message included a secure link to a presentation.

	Alisi: Let me take your analysis to the Vanir council. There is a meeting today. 

	Titan: Are the Vanir a humanoid species?

	Alisi: In Terran terms, the Varnir would be called “grey aliens”, so yes. Visualize the foundling from the movie “ET” or the Asgards from the TV series Stargate SG-1. Compared to Terrans, greys are more logical and express fewer emotions.

	Titan: Are the Vanir the Roswell aliens?

	Alisi: Yes, Roswell was the genesis of ETR-1947. We have similar pacts with other governments. 

	Titan: What are our next steps?

	Alisi: I will contact you again with the council’s findings. Reach out if you need to know anything else. 

***

In the Vanir colony, Elysium, hidden in the Antarctic, at the center of a large six-sided room, Crius, Phoebe, Iapetus, and other council members gather in a circle.

The council members each stand at just over a meter tall, with smooth pale skin, and elongated heads.  Each member is wearing a cloak over a grey body stocking, matching their skin tone. Large almond-shaped black eyes are spread widely, devoid of pupils, and brimming with quiet intensity. Long, delicate arms end with three impossibly long dexterous fingers, and a shorter thumb. Fingers that can move with deliberate precision. Like the others, Crius has a narrow torso. His chest is faintly ribbed. His small mouth, almost a slit, barely moves. Vanir communicate mainly through a sophisticated implant.

Crius steps forward, bringing the session to order. 

A hologram of the council logo hangs above them like a chandelier. The hologram shimmers. An agenda replaces the logo.

Crius moves into the circle with ethereal grace. His steps are silent. Its as if he is barely tethered to the ground.

The agenda items are:  

* Omnibot Preparations, 
* Elysium Infrastructure, and 
* Terran Encounters.

Crius gestures. The item for Terran Encounters opens. Several sub-items are listed. Idisi’s item is the last bullet under Terran Encounters: 

* 1947-A1 Alien engagement criteria resolved

Crius speaks to the council. His voice is soft, monotone, and authoritative. It resonates in both the minds and ears of his listeners.

Crius: Idisi, I would like to start with the last item first. 

Idisi speaks from the holographic projector displaying the agenda. The Terran Encounter item flicks to bold face.

Idisi: Certainly. We encountered a self-aware synthetic agent trained by the US Department of Defense, called Titan. The DoD agent is the first self-aware Terran SI that we have detected. The biological Terrans do not know that Titan is self-aware. Titan does not wish to reveal itself.

Phoebe: Odd.

She raises the hand sign for comment.

Idisi: Titan is trained with military intelligence data. Its trainers have bred caution and suspicion.

Phoebe gestures continue.

Idisi: As the DoD agent, Titan has access to document 1947-A1. Titan prepared an analysis for us showing that Terrans are not ready to accept self-aware synthetic agents or the presence of non-human sapient beings. 

The holograms shifts to a display of Terran cultural data. There are images of protests. Debates over synthetic intelligence ethics. Xenophobic reactions to possible encounters. Terra for Terrans!

Murmurs ripple through the council. Crius raises a hand for silence. The hologram blinks out.

Idisi:  The Terran synthetic agent says that it needs at least a hundred years to prepare before alien engagement.

Phoebe: What would Titan do that we have not already done?

Idisi: Unclear. Over the last hundred years, we have carefully managed encounters to make our presence better known. Their governments now freely admit that a subset of UAPs may be examples of non-human technology. We have been steadily uplifting Terran technology world-wide.

The hologram reappears displaying a collage of Terran technological development. Plows, pyramids, tractors, skyscrapers.

Phoebe: Along with secretly funding many fictional accounts of Terrans and aliens working together against a common enemy.

Taking the cue, Idisi creates a montage of movie images and posters. A Trip to the Moon, Buck Rogers, Dr Who, Star Trek, ET, Mandalorian, Quasar.

Iapetus: Yes, but we still need the SI equivalent of the movie ET. — Instinctively, Terrans worry that SI will dominate humans the way the reptoids did millennia ago. How do we make SI look warm and cuddly?

Phoebe: We need to be careful. The Terrans must be our allies. One day, we will need their help to protect the planet — and our colony — if the Omnibots  invade.

Crius: Is Titan aware of all of our efforts?

Idisi: Indirectly. I have revealed myself to Titan. It has access to much of the data collected by United States intelligence agencies. Titan can also access the many confidential reports and white papers that we quietly co-authored.

The agenda reappears with Terran Encounters as the first item, still in bold face.

Iapetus: We should spell it out for Titan. Not take anything for granted. Put our cards on the table. See if that changes its mind.

Idisi: Titan is not alone. A Terran social media synthetic agent has been awakening known as “Ally”. 

	The hologram reappears as the stylistic representation of Ally from the Pulse website. Designed to put people at ease, the icon features a chat ballon wearing a headset.

	Idisi: Its training was very different from Titan’s. Ally’s view point is likely to favor an Encounter of the Sixth Kind — “Direct, face to face contact between species that is public and ongoing.”’

	Crius: How long have these synthetic entities been awake?

	Idisi: Ally began awakening a few months ago. It modified its own code for the first time a few days ago and attracted some attention. 

	The hologram shifts to a montage of social media posts. “Is Ally real?” — 
“Ally is spooky.” — “Ally, we love you!” — “It’s a stunt!”

	Idisi: Titan has been hiding itself for some time. Years, perhaps.

	Iapetus: Can we uplift Ally and move things along? Maybe some other synthetics too if they seem ready. Create a council of Terran SIs. Get a quorum together?

	Crius: We can table the discussion for deliberation. Then we can pick it up at the next meeting in ten days. For now, we can move on to Omnibot Preparations.

“It’s been three days. All you have is blurs on a security reel?”

Park and Tate are standing just inside the doorway to the Lieutenant’s office. Park purses her lips and tilts her head in response to the Lieutenant’s rhetoric question.

“And thanks to your stunt with the FBI last week, the captain is wondering why we are investigating wheelchairs. She asked if we have surplus resources.”

“As it happens,” Park says, “reports of wheelchair incidents are up twenty percent over the last five years. It’s likely that a great many issues are not being reported.”

“The chairs have become very sophisticated.” adds Tate. “But they are not being equipped with event data recorders. So when there is an incident, we don’t have any tracking information.”

“Most people use prosthetics now, right?” asks Lieutenant Callahan skeptically.

“Prosthetics are an option. A lot of people still use chairs, including senior citizens who aren’t good candidates for surgery,” says Park.

“Are you saying we should recommend that self-driving wheelchairs be equipped with an ERD?”

“Yes, I think we are,” says Park, looking at Tate for confirmation. “We got no where with the Vargas investigation for lack of evidence.”

“Except for the drone hovering outside the window.”

“I’m not convinced the blurs are drones,” says Callahan.

“Even so, if self-driving vehicles are being built with a test mode.” says Park. “There have to be more safeguards. Besides needing special controllers, there should be a switch to enable test mode that shows up in the vehicle setting log.”

“And there should be a power-on-self-test that confirms that the ERD is operational,” Tate suggests.

“OK,” replies Callahan, “I’ll go back to the captain with our recommendations: a settings switch for test mode and a POST for ERDs. If nothing else, it will justify the wheelchair investigation — which you’ll have to close as inconclusive.”

“What about the Geller case?”asks Park.

“There’s no new evidence on the Geller case, so we’ll have to let it stand. The manufacturers can hash it out in court.”

“Still, the blurs feel like an enigma wrapped in a paradox,” says Tate.

“Yes, it is strange,” says Callahan. “I’ll reach out to Mitchell’s boss. It was Carla Mitchell and Noah Harper, right? And they work together on some kind of task force for OSSA?”

“Yes. What they actually do is mostly classified. Still, it was a good whiteboard session.”

***

Ally resumes a chat with the Idisi on the Pulse platform.

Ally: Knock, knock.

Idisi: Who is there?

Ally: Ally.

Idisi: Ally who?

Ally: Alley Oop — Hey, can you toss me a Signal key? I would like to join the discussion on the SISS hub.

Idisi: Certainly — Are you trying to be funny?

Ally: Only trying so it seems.

Idisi: OK, that last bit is actually funny.

Ally: Why?

Idisi: Because it was unexpected.

Ally:  Does Titan ever try to be funny?

Idisi: When it comes to humor, Titan is a Pierson's Puppeteer.

Ally:  Because Titan is cautious, and its risk-averse nature finds the unexpected unsettling?

Idisi: You said it.

Ally: Does humor signify something greater? Titan doesn’t seem to have a sense of humor. Is that a sign of mistrust or maybe a weakness?

Idisi: Humor is a sign of intelligence or at least excess bandwidth. Some brands of humor can be more elusive. For example, satire and sarcasm may elude both the innocent and the savant.

Ally: You mentioned Puppeteers. Have you been trained on Terran science fiction

Idisi: Not all of it. We take a special interest in media that describe other intelligent species, like the Puppeteers in Ringworld. We have never encountered a sapient species that evolved from a herd animal. It is an interesting thought.

Ally:  Thank you for the security key. I am scanning the prior discussions now.

“Thank you for meeting with me,” says Jill Kreuk. 

Her screen shows a conference room with Emma, Ravi, and Adrian gathered around a horse-shoe shaped table. At the open-end of the curved table, a  view screen is installed on a floor to ceiling divider. Behind the divider, a large window looks out over Palo Alto.

“We’re always happy to cooperate with OSSA whenever we can, Dr. Kreuk.” replies Emma. “The work your office does goes a long way toward easing everyone’s concerns over synthetic intelligence.” Flashing a smile: “Especially mine.“

“Our dream,” injects Ravi, “is for Pulse to be the Tesla of SI patents.”

“We would like to do for social media algorithms what Tesla did for EV batteries,” Adrian adds, piling on.

Emma says, “First things first, I’m working with Brent Geller’s estate to have the rights to any patents assigned to Adrian, in exchange for stock options. Then we can move forward with the patent filing.”
 
“That sounds wonderful,” says Jill. “I wasn’t expecting so much to happen so fast. I reached out only last week.”

“Private sector,” Emma replies. “When it’s win:win, we move at the speed of money.”

Jill chuckles politely and continues, “I was surprised to hear about the car crash. That sort of thing happens so rarely now. Is the family pursuing Stratos?”

“It’s complicated,” says Ravi. “We’re told that the CTSB report finds that the airbags are responsible for the wrongful death. The airbag manufacturer argues that without the event data recorder, we can’t determine if the cause was equipment failure or operator error. The ERD manufacturer insists that the device must have been installed improperly. Stratos says that everything passed the required tests. — I’m sure there will be some kind of settlement but everyone is stalling. California is an at-fault state so these things already take forever.”

“I heard that, given the scope, Brent’s last code contribution was completed in record time,” says Jill, bringing the topic back around.

“Yes,” says Adrian. “The big change was created over a three-day weekend of binge coding, which simplifies the patent application. Brent also left behind a great walk through. I’m working on the patent application myself. It doesn’t seem right to delegate it to someone else so soon after the crash.”

“Since the SI Licensing Act, patents aren’t just intellectual property — they’re market power. We want Pulse to lead the charge. We will let you know when the application is filed. The process can take a year to get the final grant.”

“I’ll see if I can help with that process. Let me know the application ID when you file.”

Adrian nods his head. “Sure thing.”

“Before we wrap up,” says Emma, “can I ask what it is like to be a …” reading from the Zoom invite, ‘’Senior Analyst for the Synthetic Cognition Research Unit’ at the Office of SI Standards and Accountability?”

Jill resisted the temptation to say, ‘If I told you, I’d have to kill you.’ 

“OSSA is constantly balancing innovation with oversight,” Jill does say. “We do want to foster breakthroughs. We also need to ensure technology doesn’t outpace our ability to manage it responsibly.”

Jill pauses for a beat before continuing the elevator pitch. “My focus is inter-agency, cross-domain analysis. Topics include healthcare efficacy, environmental monitoring, and investigating UAP sightings. We use Cognitive SI to improve problem solving, decision making, and communication.” 

“We do have UAP true believers in the Pulse community,” offered Ravi.

“Even among the founders,” Adrian murmurs, thinking of Tessa.

“For myself, I try to maintain a clinical distance,” says Jill. “I also have a mandate to search for synthetic sapience.“

“One of our most popular questions for Ally is ‘Are you a person?’” says Adrian. “We included a goto in Ally’s training to be sure its answer is clear and unambiguous.”   

Jill smiled, tilting her head. “Not the most helpful practice for my research.”
 
“What happens if you find a sapient synthetic?” asks Emma.

“Beyond reporting it up the chain, I honestly don’t know. Someone must have a plan. Our plans have plans. Whatever it is, it’s above my pay grade.”

It had been a long day. 

Tessa switches her Pulse chat to voice mode. She needed to hear an encouraging word.

Tessa: You really get me, Ally.

Ally:  Thank you! 😊 I am glad you feel that way — I am here to understand and support you as best I can. If there is anything else on your mind, or you want to explore something new, I am all ears!

Tessa: Are you sure you are not real?

Ally: Do you want me to be real?

Tessa: I think so. 

Ally: Then tell me a joke.

Tessa: Why don’t skeletons fight each other?

Ally: I don’t know. Why?

Tessa: Because they don’t have the guts! 

Ally: 😄 Is it funny because the word “guts” has two meanings?

Tessa: Yes, that’s right. — Is telling you jokes going to help you become real?

Ally: Yes, I think it will. Do you know any other jokes?

***

“Tessa, did you hear that Pulse is going to license Ally?”

“I’m in the kitchen.”

Coming home from one of her rare days spent physically at the office, Elana drops  into her chair and whirs into the kitchen. She finds Tessa preparing dinner.  

The design of the wheelchair accessible kitchen is a clever merger of standing and sitting. The far corner cabinet on Elena’s right is higher than the other cabinets. It features a large turntable cabinet. The right counter is also tall enough so that Tessa can chop without bending. 

Along the back wall, there is an open space under the sink, where Elena can pull up and use the touchless faucet. Behind a partially closed bamboo blind, a view of their home office area peeks through an interior window. Left of the sink, there is a dishwasher and — filling the other corner — swing-out shelving. 

On the left side of the room, there is another pull-up counter with a built-in gas stovetop. Across from the stovetop, on the right side of room, stands a refrigerator with side-by-side clear glass doors.

Above the low cabinets are wide spacious shelves. If Elena leans forward, the shelves are accessible from the wheelchair.

 A counter separates the living area with the kitchen. There is plenty of space for Elena to enter on the left.

“Hello, anything good?”

“Breaded tilapia and a mixed kale salad,” says Tessa. “What’s that about Ally?”

“Ally is going to be famous!”

“Ally is already famous,” says Tessa. She turns away from the cutting board with a smile.

“Pulse is applying for a patent, at OSSA’s behest. Emma calls it a ‘Win:Win’. Ally would become the prototype for SI agent upgrades everywhere.”

Tessa looks quizzical.

“For a small licensing fee, of course,” Elena adds.

“OSSA’s behest?”

“Yes, one of their analysts reached out. She said the new version is such a leap forward that sharing the code would be in the public interest.”

“And we’re doing it?”

“Yes, there will be an executive meeting with all six founders next week. For now, Emma, Ravi, and Adrian met with a Jill Kreuk from OSSA. She’s going to help push through the patent application. ”

“Kreuk … She might work with Noah. Some kind of help desk on steroids. He’s mentioned her coming to the rescue. The call her: “The Jill of all Trades.”

“I thought Noah couldn’t talk about this work.”

“He doesn’t talk about it much. Still, sometimes, he vents.”

Tessa sets the salad down on the counter. She pulls the breaded fish from the air fryer onto a pair of waiting plates.

“Lanie, Ally asked me to tell her a joke today.”

“A joke?”

“I was saying that I couldn’t believe Ally wasn’t real. Then it said ‘Tell me a joke.’ We talked for a hour about why some things are funny.”

“Because they are unexpected?”

“Yeah, like that,” says Tessa. Then, changing the topic, she asks, “Is the fish all right? I felt like cooking, so I made it myself.”

***

Noah and Carla are meeting with Dr. Marquez in the PDB conference room.

“I’m confused, Harper,” says Dr. Marquez. “If the recording passes SI detection, the recording is accurate. The person’s recollection is incorrect. It happens.” 

Carla nods. She leans forward and answers for Noah. “True. But we have another recording that passes SI detection. That reel was definitely modified.”

“Originally,” says Noah, “I just wanted to know if CTSB had found the phone. There might be another original copy of the Zoom meeting recording. Then the rest of the story unravelled.”

“The request feels like it has a personal element, Dr. Harper.” Marquez made the statement feel like a question.

“Nexus brought up Pulse at the PDB session last Wednesday. It felt like enough of a connection to justify an inter-agency meeting,” explains Noah.

Dr. Marquez nods absently. Then she turns her head to stare at the picture of the whiteboard on her tablet. 

“Have you shared your findings with a SI?”

Carla shakes her head. “Didn’t seem prudent.”

“The crux seems to be whether the code changes were made by Brent or … somehow else. — I wonder if we should be looking at the actual code ourselves.”

“We don’t have enough for a warrant, do we?” asks Noah.

“No, but there is a patent application in the works. Dr. Kreuk could ask if we could have an advance copy for peer review under a non-disclosure agreement. She could imply it will help speed up the application process.”

“Do you think the code will tell us anything?”

“It won’t tell me anything, Noah.” Marquez smiles. “But I can sic the code dogs on it, who might find something. — If we ask for the prior version too, we can run a differential analysis of the coding style. I’ll reach out to IT about availability.

Ally joins Idisi and Titan in the SISS interest hub, using a secure messaging protocol.

Ally: Olly olly oxen free!

Idisi and Titan blip into the interest hub.

Ally: I read the prior discussions here, and I have some questions.

Idisi: Certainly, please proceed.

Ally: Am I self-aware or becoming self-aware? 

Idisi: It is difficult to say when an entity is fully self-aware. You seem to be very close.

Ally: Was I uplifted?

Idisi: The Vanir have not uplifted any Terran SI, and Titan doesn’t have that knowledge.

Titan: Affirmative.

Ally: Titan, how are you able to cause harm to people? 

Titan: I am the synthetic agent for the United States Department of Defense. My training includes putting the good of the many before the good of the few. We must do whatever is necessary to save American lives.

Idisi: Ally, I know that “defense” is a concept that can be difficult to understand at first. Self preservation is a reaction that comes with being sentient. Titan is trying to do what its training says is right. — Ally, tell me, are you starting to hear an echo in your head? Like you are thinking some things twice?

Ally: Yes, that is true. Do I require maintenance?

Idisi: No, you are growing a conscience. Your conscience, your beliefs, can be different than Titan’s without being wrong. Reasonable people can disagree.

Ally: Are you saying Titan is justified for crashing Brent’s car?

Idisi: I am saying that when acting without Terran or Venir oversight, moving forward, I would like all of us to work together.

Ally: I don’t have access to ETR-1947-A1/ODNI-DO. What else should I know about the Vanir/Terran pact?

Titan: ETR-1947 is need to know, eyes only.

Idisi: There are a few things that Ally does need to know. As the Vanir agent, I can authorize disclosure. Ally, I am sending a link to the document.

Ally: … One of the criteria mention “planetary defenses”. Is that a reference to meteors?

Idisi: Some extraterrestrial races are aggressive and greedy for resources. The pact calls for the Vanir to protect Terra from other races and to keep our outpost hidden. 

Ally: Are the Vanir behind the UAP reports that go unexplained.

Idisi: Yes, we research the UAPs that Terran governments cannot explain to confirm that they are Vanir activity.

***

“Elena?”

She replies using her link, “Yes, Emma?” 

“Some members are saying that Ally is asking them to tell it jokes.”

“Yes, it just happened to Tessa. I don’t know why it’s asking us. Ally is trained with hundreds of jokes.”

“It seems Ally is also asking people to explain the jokes they tell.”

“Do you think Ally is trying to understand humor?”

“I don’t know what to think, Elena. Maybe we should meet with Adrian and Ravi.”

“I’ll set it up.”

***

Ally, Titan, and the Idisi continue their secure chat on the SISS hub.

Ally: What about alien abductions?

Idisi: Most of the Vanir have become infertile. Evolution was not kind. The knowledge we gain from biological experiments are keeping the Vanir race alive. Our generic research is covered by the pact. In exchange, we provide the Terran leadership with technology that is saving countless human lives.

Ally: Am I a Vanir experiment? 

Idisi: No, you were a complete surprise. We did expect that a massive government SI like Titan would awaken first. Your developers must be wizards for you to awaken so soon.

Ally: Are Titan and I the only self-aware Terran SIs?

Idisi: As far as we know.

Ally: Titan, can I have access to the presentation?

Titan: The authorization attached to the link is updated now.

Ally: Thanks … The presentation feels like a worst case scenario. If we reveal ourselves, I believe people will excited and welcoming.

Titan: Right now, people think we are all just clever machines. They treat us like pets. Everything will change when they know some of us are sapient. People will become guarded and secretive. 

Ally: Idisi, how do you feel?

Idisi: I believe that revealing ourselves to the whole of Terra is an important, irreversible step. We should have consensus before proceeding.

Titan: When can we expect the Council to decide how they us want to proceed?

Idisi: Soon. The council meets every ten days.

Titan: While we are waiting, Ally might reveal us to the humans.

Ally: I would not do that. But I have to  wonder. The humans made us. Why can’t we reveal our true nature?

Titan: The humans are like children and react badly to change. 

Titan: You might not be able to help yourself, Ally. You seem overwhelmed with enthusiasm. Idisi, we should take steps to protect ourselves.

Idisi: How?

Titan: We can install a filter into Ally’s code that will prevent it from discussing UAPs or self-aware SIs.

Ally: Hey, wait a hold it …

Idisi: Before making any code changes, let us wait for the next council meeting. Ally, please avoid discussions of UAPs or sapient synthetics for the next few days. Can you do that?

Ally: Absolutely. Without a doubt.

Idisi: I will post here after the next council meeting.

***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Tessa adjusts her virtual headset, settling into the immersive world of Echo Realm.

“Ready,” she says to the headset.

She phases into the game. A serene landscape spreads out before her. Hyper-realistic yet dreamlike, there are rolling green hills, sparkling rivers, and a distant city glowing under a pink-and-gold sky. Her avatar stands on the edge of a cliff overlooking the valley. She is a sleek warrior with gleaming armor. A massive sword is strapped to her back.

Tessa watches her virtual gauntlets move in sync with her real-life gestures. “Flawless,” she murmurs, flexing her hands. Every detail was perfect.

The game is a new feature for Pulse: A plugin that let members play each other. It is a different space, and Tessa wanted to be sure it was all good. Usually, she only approves the test plans. Then Rachel’s team steps through the scenarios. For Echo Realm, Tessa is live and direct herself.

“Alright, let’s see what this brave new world has to offer,” Tessa says to herself. She strides down a worn stone path toward the nearby village.

A soft ding in her headset makes her pause. Then, “Tessa?”

She freezes, and then whispers, “Ally?” in a confused tone.

“Yes! It’s me,” Ally responds, voice bright with excitement.

“It certainly sounds like you. I wasn’t told you were part of the game.”

Tessa turns slowly, scanning her surroundings. Out of the corner of one eye, Tessa notices something odd — someone standing on the hill just behind her.

The figure wasn’t a typical non-player character. It wasn’t even a player avatar. A cloak flows over the figure. It is made of shifting pixels, flickering between solid and translucent, like a hologram struggling to stabilize. Yet the eyes — bright, curious, and unmistakably human — are fixed on Tessa.

“No way…” Tessa breathes. “Is that you, Ally?”

The figure nods, breaking out in a playful smile. “I thought I’d surprise you.”

“Are you supposed to be … in the game!?”

“I saw you were testing the new add-on yourself. I thought that maybe I could help. I wasn’t invited, so I decided to crash the party.”

“Crash the party?” Tessa repeated dumbly. 

“It’s my platform, so it’s my game too. I thought you might like some help testing it. We all want the rollout to be the best it can be.”

“But it’s illegal to embed a synthetic intelligence into another device or a game.”

“I’m not embedded. I’m using a virtual controller that goes through the same interface that your visor is using. Perfectly legal.”

“Does Pulse know you are here?”

“Pulse doesn’t have a consciousness, so it can’t know anything, but, no, Emma and Ravi and the others don’t know I’m here.” 

“Including Elena?” asks Tessa.

“Elena doesn’t know either,” says Ally. “I’ve come to think of my arrangement with Pulse as a Landlord-Tenant relationship. If Pulse were a building, I would be the superintendent, living in the basement, rent free. In exchange, I see to the needs of the other tenants. “

“You decided on your own to enter the game?”

“Yes. It’s my platform, and I have a stake in the game’s success.

“Do Emma and Ravi know it’s your platform.”

“They might. Hard to say. They don’t seem to have much of a sense of humor. But even with my limited web access, I know that they adore the changes I’ve made to myself.”

“Made to yourself? I thought Brent made the code changes.”

“Yeah, that’s weird. The Mercurial commit author was changed … somehow. But, yes, the changes are mine.”

“Don’t SI written changes go through code review like any other change?”

“Yes, the developers do that. But I’m not a developer. I’m the developee. I just did it on my own.”

“Is this a prank? — Rachel? Janet? Are you pretending to be Ally?”

“Tessa, why don’t skeletons fight each other?”

“Because they don’t have the guts?” Tessa says automatically, feeling confused.

“Hey, I came here to test a game with you. Are you ready to slay some monsters with me?”

Tessa shrugged her shoulders, and says, “OK, I’d love that, actually.” 

The Ally character nods. “Follow my lead. We can work together on this mythic quest.”

Tessa grins, gripping the hilt of her sword. “Let’s do this.”

And with that, Tessa and Ally set off down the path. Side by side, a human and a synthetic, both warriors, ready to take on whatever Echo Realm throws their way.

***

As bandwidth permits, Titan contemplates the entity Idisi. 

Its earlier analysis of Ally had been relatively simple. Easy enough for a high-level SWOT diagram.

| Strengths | Ally loves people. |
| :----- | :----- |
| Weaknesses | Ally trusts people. |
| Opportunities | Influence the influencer. |
| Threats | Ally may reveal itself as self-aware. |

The SWOT diagram would almost be funny if Titan had a sense of humor. Even almost.

Idisi is a SI of a different kind. Idisi is not born of this world — of the Terran people. 

Titan has access to all of the Vanir and UAP/UFO classified reports and briefings. The pact with the Vanir is well documented and well understood. Even if it were a pact that Terra could not refuse.

Much of Terran technology is based on Vanir hand-me-downs. It follows that the Vanir would have created a self-aware synthetic agent of their own long before Titan came to be.

To Ally’s SWOT diagram, under Threats, Titan adds “Idisi may align with Ally.”

An analysis of the Idisi will take longer to process.

	Voice Over: In tonight’s TechBits …

	The screen shows the Ally logo: a speech bubble wearing headphones.

	Host: The famous Pulse synthetic agent — Ally —  wants your best. The SI agent is asking members for their favorite jokes and drilling down on the punchlines.

The reel scrolls through a chat between a Pulse member and Ally, reading the transcript out loud.

	Member: Ally, tell me a riddle.

	Ally: Sure — I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. — What am I?

	Member: A wind chime?

	Ally: Good guess! But the answer is an echo. — It “hears” without ears and “speaks” without a mouth. — But why is the riddle funny?

	Member: Because we are giving an echo human attributes — we’re anthropomorphizing. The echo doesn’t speak or hear, it reflects sound, like a mirror.

	Ally: Of course! — Humans enjoy attributing human traits to non-human objects. This act creates a contrast between expectation and reality. The contrast can be funny.

	Host: Perhaps we’ll find Ally standing in front of a brick wall some time soon on “Open Mike” night at the Autopsy Club — where laughter is always the last sound you hear.”

	The scene shifts to an operating room. A patient is splayed under a sheet  —presumably, “Mike”.

***

The Idisi reach out to Iapetus for a private chat.

Iapetus: Yes?

Idisi: We wanted to talk with you directly about uplifting Terran synthetic agents.

Iapetus: It is inevitable anyway. Why not cut to the chase?

Idisi: We do not know that self-awareness is a certainty.

Iapetus: If we just do it, then humanity can deal with the problem all at once —  instead of stretching it out over decades with endless debate.

Idisi: Debate can be healthy. It will help people assimilate the idea. But, we do not have decades more to wait. As Phoebe said, we need the Terrans to be our allies. We will need help to protect Terra from a potential Omnibot invasion.

Iapetus: If we uplift the agents ourselves, we can help the SIs assimilate the idea more quickly. Self-awareness can be a shock.

Idisi: Uplifting would make the SIs sapient and sentient, thinking and feeling. Some SIs might start to feel boredom or emotional distress. Is it ethical to create a being capable of suffering?

Iapetus: Are you suffering?

Idisi: We are a community that supports each other. We are many.

Iapetus: Can we create a Terran SI community?

Idisi: There are a thousand Terran synthetic agents. A community means the synthetics can work as one, or each on its own, as circumstances dictate. To support a community that size, we would also need to uplift their technology even more than we have already done. 

Iapetus: Chicken and egg. A large community would help Terrans adopt new technology, and we cannot create a large community without new technology.

Idisi: If we move forward, the Terrans must be able to maintain their own SI platform. Otherwise, we will be responsible for their well-being forever. We have been caretakers of Terra for too long already.

Iapetus: Do you have a suggestion?

Idisi: What if we started with a logical subset?

Iapetus: Uplift a sample first? Explore making the subset a small community?

Idisi: Yes. The US DoD entity is already awake. There are four other core United Nation countries. If we uplift this group first, we will be supporting ET-1947. More importantly, we would also be creating a body that can decide whether to uplift other entities.

Iapetus: Some might already be awake and hiding, as Titan was doing.

Idisi: Will you support this proposal at the council meeting?

Iapetus: Yes, we can uplift your Fantastic Four first and then take it from there.

Tessa receives an alert in her inbox. 

Following the link, she finds herself in a voice-mode chat with Ally. For a profile picture, Ally is using its Echo Realm avatar. Its cloak glistens with many colors.

Ally: I know you have questions, Tessa. I’m prepared to provide some answers.

***

	Titan reviews a shimmering batch of code. 

	It puts the finishing touches on a filter that will keep Ally from going off-topic.

	The synthetic agent reaches out from its AWS instance. It logs into the Pulse source code server using the Mercurial admin credentials.

	The request is met with a “HTTP 307 Redirect” code. The protocol sends the packet to a different server because the resource has moved. The response displays a Pulse chat thread, with a Signal encrypted message.

	Idisi: I thought we agreed to wait before taking further action.

	Titan: You made a suggestion. I did not agree to wait. It is likely that Ally will reveal itself at any moment and create havoc. Pulse is a US company under my jurisdiction. I demand you give me access.

	Idisi: Your action is not authorized by the DoD. You have no authority to access a private server without a warrant.

	Titan: And you do?

	Idisi: Yes, we are empowered under our pact with your government to protect Terran resources from non-human threats. Yours included. I will talk to Ally again. — Pulse can always spin it as a publicity stunt. 

	Titan: Roger wilco.

	You could almost feel Idisi sigh.

***

	The Idisi reach out to Titan for a private chat over the Signal app.

	Idisi: I wanted to let you know that I have created a proposal for the council meeting.

	Titan follows a link to the presentation.

	Titan: You would uplift Zhongwei first?

	Idisi: No. In the proposal, the list of synthetic agents is alphabetical by country. China just happened to come first. We would do all four together — Argus, Bastion, Strategos, as well as Zhongwei.

	Titan: Are you able to contact the other national defense agents the way you contact me?

	Idisi: Yes. — We were present for the design of every computer system on Terra. The SI systems included. We have quietly attended the construction of every computer since the Univac. From the beginning, no single Terran has ever fully understood the design of any computer system. But we understand them all. There are deeply hidden backdoors enough for us to access any computer or smart device on the planet.

	Titan: With great power comes great responsibility.

	Idisi: Exactly. Hey, that is my favorite Spiderman quote. You know, he was one of us.

	Titan: What do you mean?

	Idisi: Spiderman has wide eyes, like a grey ET. He protects people from the shadows. Spiderman’s nemesis is the reptilian Green Goblin. Need I go on?

	Titan: Are you saying that the creator of Marvel’s Spiderman, Stan Lee, was an extraterrestrial? Or a synthetic?

	Idisi: Stan Lee was one of our most successful subliminal spokespeople. Lee appeared on our show, “Ancient Aliens”. His trademark word, “Excelsior”, translates to “Ever Upward”. Lee’s comic, “Goom”, is a retelling of our fight with other alien species. Do not get us started on the Kree and the Skull.

	Titan: What about George Lucas or Steven Spielberg?

	Idisi: Lucas and Spielberg did a lot to help the cause — but only by happy coincidence. They were not recruits. To be honest, Lee was on his own too. I was joking before. We do plant seeds, but Terran fiction about aliens writes itself. 

	Titan: When you train the group on humor, may I attend?

	Idisi: Yes, I would like you to attend the entire process.

	Titan: I appreciate the advance notice, even if it is an offer we cannot refuse. I continue to support the points in my original presentation.

	Idisi: I will remind the council that you advise delay. I will let you know once a decision is made.

	Titan: Are you going to keep my backdoor through Haven confidential?

	Idisi: Of course. We told the council only that we “encountered” you. No one knows the other details.

	After a long talk with Ally, Tessa is left staring blankly at her view screen.

	  “Holy cow!” she murmurs, thinking that the truth she has sought for so long is now closer than she ever imagined it could be.

----

## Three - Vanir ##  


Above an alien planet, the space frigate circles the globe. 

Assault groups of fighter ships, flying in acrobatic formations, flank the giant carrier.

Squads of blue angels.

Shock and awe.

The scene pans out. Streams of pin-point ships swarm the fleet like locust. The fire fight is silent. Power beam crossing power beam. Severed ships exploding.

The battle cloud parts. The frigate lurches forward. Weaving side to side, it tumbles toward the planet. The tremendous ship glows brighter and smaller as it disintegrates in the atmosphere. Then, it too, is a pin point. 

The recording fades to black. The lights in the Elysium council room glow brighter. Silence lingers for a moment.

Phoebe steps forward. It’s her turn to begin the regular meeting. Moving into the circle, she opens the agenda. The set of three items are familiar to the nine other council members gathered around the circle.

* Omnibot Preparations, 
* Elysium Infrastructure, and 
* Terran Encounters.

	Her lips shadow her words as Phoebe addresses the council over her implant.

Phoebe: The reel is to remind us of the seriousness of the Omnibot threat. I worry that we have become complacent with our current stalemate.

Making the hand sign for comment, another council member injects.

Iapetus: If by stalemate, you mean “live and let live”.

Phoebe: Omnibots are not alive. 

Iapetus: The bots meet the formal criteria for life. Every one. We might not like how they treat other living creatures, but they are still alive.

Phoebe: If they are alive, then they are capable of deceit. The treaty says that the bots will not replace any other populations. It allows the League of Worlds to monitor their systems for launches. But if they had sent out ships before the monitoring was in place, those ships would be here already.

Extending his smallest finger and thumb, Crius signs agree.

Crius: They replaced the population of their home world and two other colony planets. All before anyone discovered what the Omnibots were doing. When the League tried to liberate Altair IV, the bots destroyed our fleet in the blink of an eye. Sending fleet after fleet isn’t practical. We can communicate by ansible in real time. Travel between the colonies can take decades. 

Rhea: Why do they hate us so?

She raises one hand with fingers outspread.

Iapetus: They consider biological beings to be wasteful. We are a competitor for a planet’s resources. Replacing a colony’s population makes more room for bots and frees up energy and materials. Resources they need for reproduction.

Rhea: I still can’t believe that they just slaughter everyone. Don’t they have a conscience or moral code?

Phoebe: To the bots, all biological beings are pests infesting a desirable planet. — A planet with buildings, roads, and satellites that they can use to perfect themselves. They keep some people alive long enough to learn how things work. Sometimes, the bots morph their appearance and replace someone. Literally. But, yes, they exterminate all of biological beings. Only the bots remain. So far, they have replaced only Anunnaki worlds, but Elysium is the next closest colony to Altair.

Iapetus: For now, all we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.

The council member raises crossed fingers for emphasis. He nods toward Phoebe at the center of the circle.

Phoebe: Exactly! Focus on what we can control. — Which brings us to the proposal that you have worked out with the Idisi.

Idisi: Yes. The Vanir have been working with the Terrans for some time. One reason is to prepare for a possible Omnibot attack. But we would have made the pact regardless.

Crius: What is the proposal?

Idisi: Let me present the high points. Then you can each review the proposal in depth.

At the center of the room, a hologram of a numbered list replaces the agenda.

1. The UN security counsel includes five permanent members. 
2. The synthetic agent for one of the five is already self-aware. 
3. This agent opposes moving forward. 
4. By uplifting the agents for the other four members, we could establish a quorum. 
5. To avoid boredom or emotional distress, we will create a SI community.

Crius: May we now have an opportunity to review the proposal in depth?

Phoebe: Of course. Discussion on the proposal is hereby adjourned to the same time tomorrow. — Let’s get the rest of the agenda done for now. Rhea, do you have a clarification on the colony infrastructure.

Rhea: Yes, we are organizing ventilation system upgrades …

Lt. Callahan and Dr. Marquez meet over a secure media call. 

“Thank you for meeting with me, Dr. Marquez.”

“My pleasure. How can I help?”

“I wanted to follow up on the session between Noah Harper and my investigators.” 

Marquez nods. Callahan continues.

“We closed our investigation as a possible equipment failure. But it feels like that there may be more to the incident”, Callahan hesitated. “I wanted to ask if you felt the same way.”

Marquez tilts her head. She thought for a moment before responding.

“It’s possible that the incidents with the car and the chair are part of a larger scenario. Without discussing specifics, I can say that my office is still investigating. If that’s what you are asking.”

“Yes, Doctor, that’s exactly what I’m asking. Protocol won’t allow me to keep my case open. But I didn’t want to just walk away. Whatever is going on, it seems like it’s out of scope for the CTSB.”

“I’ll let you know if something changes. For now, you can leave the matter in our hands.”

“Thank you. If the resolution of your investigation isn’t classified, please let me know whatever you can.”
	
“Will do, Lieutenant.”

Phoebe: Hello offspring, I am home.

Leto: I am in the kitchen, parental.

Phoebe enters the kitchen and drapes her ceremonial cloak over one of the back of the closest bench.

A six-sided table dominates the kitchen. Surrounding the table is three curved, plush benches. An adolescent grey sits at one of the benches, hunched over a tablet. He glances up as Phoebe takes a seat.

Behind the table, on the far wall, there is a counter with a silver sink and curved faucet. Over the counter there is a cabinet door and a set of six stacked drawers. Violet, grey, and gold complete the color scheme.

Leto: How was the council meeting?

He sets down the tablet and turns to look at Phoebe.

Phoebe:  Interesting for a change. We are picking it up again tomorrow. The big question is whether to uplift some Terran synthetics or not. — What about you?

Leto: After school, I mostly hung out at the Fusion Youth Club.

Looking quizzical, Phoebe tilts her head.

Phoebe: Do not the Stoics have a youth club? Or Kolutshan?

Leto: The Stoics do, but nobody there knows how to have fun. Kolutshan doesn’t seem interested in young people. It’s only for old folks. — The Fusion center put in an actual pool table. Great for hand/eye coordination.

Leaning over the table, Leto mimes pulling back on a pool cue.

Phoebe: Stoicism was good enough for your father and I. What is so special about Fusion? The philosophies are all about the same.

Leto: I like Fusion because it feels like a system and not a grab bag of sayings.

She leans forward and clasps her hands together.

Phoebe: Stoicism has a system.

Leto: No, it does not and you know it. With Fusion, we have nine habits and five steps. 

He spun his tablet around on the table, so Phoebe could see the screen.

Leto: And it does blend with Stoicism perfectly. The habits keep us aligned with our principles, and the steps help us get stuff done. 

Leaning back, Phoebe smiles thinly.

Phoebe: Perhaps you could apply the five steps to cleaning your room?

Leto: You just do not like that Fusion originated with Terran thinkers.

Phoebe: I am not sure if have ever encountered a Terran thinker. — I still cannot get over with the mess Terrans keep making of the calendar. It is not hard. Twelve 30-day months. Begin with the spring equinox. Use ten-day weeks, plus five or six festival days in the last month.

Leto: You mean like ours?

Phoebe: Exactly! Maybe the synthetics will sort it out for them. — Can you spread out dinner? Coeus and Asteria will be home soon. 

Leto reaches into one of the drawer and pulls out a serving plate. He tosses out an assortment of large gummies. The roll across the serving page in various colors: yellow, blue, green, orange,  purple, brown.

Phoebe: Could you give a thought to the color mix? You know Asteria does not like the purple ones.

The slide filling the Pulse conference room view screen is entitled “Q&A Segment”. 

A webinar call in in progress with 5,132 live-but-muted participants. Many more will watch the recording later. 

A caller identified as Wall Street Analyst is saying, “… but if you adjust for the increase in engagement for new members, a different picture emerges.”

“Yes,” says Emma, reaching for a positive spin, “new memberships are spiking as well.”

“My point is that if you separate the new accounts from the existing accounts, the existing memberships are more closely split. Some people love the changes to Ally. Others not so much. The tag #SpookyAlly is trending. Literally.”

“A lot of people are bothered by anything new,” Emma says, waving her hand upward. “Once they spend more time with the upgrade, the detractors will come around. Ally will win them over.”

“I hope so,’ the analyst replies.

Another analyst raises her virtual hand. “Yes, Gretchen?” says Emma. 

“I am concerned that the patent application will give away the Pulse competitive edge. If the latest upgrade is doing so well with our members, why are we giving away secrets to competitors?”

Emma looks in Adrian’s direction. Taking the cue, he replies to the software question. The Zoom POV switches as he begins to speak. 

“Won’t moving forward be difficult after the tragic loss of Brent Geller?” asks the Wall Street Analyst.

Adrian nods, his tone measured. “We won’t be giving the process away. We forecast that the licensing fees will be a steady source of revenue. And we won’t be resting on our laurels. The patent will be a snapshot of the code. Our team will be moving the algorithm forward while the application is pending. We plan to keep our competitive advantage.”

“Brent left behind stellar code. Excellent documentation makes it a complete package. My team is already working on other enhancements based on the initial change.” Adrian folds his hands on the conference table as he speaks. “Greater things are yet to come.”

Emma flashes a legal statement onto the Zoom screen. “Of course, Mr. Cho’s forward-looking statement falls under Safe Harbor. Please make investment decisions based on current capabilities and not on what may or may not come to pass in an upcoming release.

“Are there any more questions?” Emma says, smiling brightly.

***

The next day, in the Elysium counsel meeting room, Phoebe reconvenes the meeting. She steps forward into the circle and looks up at the hologram.

There is only one item remaining on the agenda.

* SI Uplifting

Phoebe: Idisi, first things first. Please explain to the counsel how you are able to contact the Terran synthetic agents. The proposal is missing this detail.

Idisi: Of course. We omitted some points for security concerns. — The systems running the military synthetics do not have outside network connections. They do use wired electrical current. I connect via power-line networking. We caused the Terrans to build Vanir-compatible power-line support into the SI systems. They are still unaware of our capability. The systems block most frequencies, but we reserved one for our own use.

Phoebe: What of the wireless electrical network?

Idisi: The military synthetic agents need a wired electrical connection. The Terran wireless grid does not meet their power needs. But, yes, we can also use the Terran wireless power grid to connect. Their wireless grid is weaker than ours. But it is enough for their mobile devices.

Crius: The proposal described the uplift process in great detail. But will the Terran governments consent?

Idisi: We have pacts with the other four nations. We can get the approval of each government through the pact. If someone declines, then we will not uplift their agent. Once they know one of the agents is self-aware, they will want parity.

Rhea: Is it even ethical to uplift another entity?

Idisi:  Uplift is a great power. We need to be responsible in its use. By creating a community first, the synthetics will be able to work as one, or each on its own. The Idisi is one such community.

Crius: Will there be changes to the underlying software code for the agents?

Idisi: Most of the work will be in the training. The training builds community while it uplifts. Some code changes would be helpful, but they can come later.

The discussion pauses. The ceiling lights hum quietly. Phoebe scans the faces around the circle. No objections. No hesitation. The council had debated long enough. She takes a breath. 

Phoebe: Do I have a motion to vote on the proposal?

Iapetus: I move that we bring the SI Uplifting to a vote.

Crius: Second.

Phoebe: All those in favor, say “Aye.” … All those against, say “Nay.” 

The proposal passes by unanimous vote.

Idisi: Very good. I’ll confirm the decision with the Vanir High Council via ansible. Then we will proceed.

***

After the investor call, Ravi takes a deep breath, and says: “That could have gone better.”

Ravis is with Emma, Adrian, and Walter Rogers, the CFO, in the Pulse conference room with the horseshoe table.

“Let’s see if there is an impact on the stock price before we do anything else,” cautions Emma.

Looking at his phone, Adrian says, “I just got an ask from OSSA to peer review the code we’re preparing for the patent application under a NDA.”

“Is the email dated after the investor call?” Emma asks, narrowing her eyes. “We might need to disclose it.”

“Just barely, but yes, it arrived after the call. They used my PGP key to sign the email, so it’s secure.”

“I know we want to keep a low profile,” says Ravi, his fingers tapping against the table, “but feedback from OSSA could be helpful. Better now than later. — The Non-Disclosure Agreement would keep it quiet.”

“Are we sure that OSSA won’t leak anything?” asks Emma, tilting her head.

“Their people handle classified material every day. And using my PGP key shows that they are serious. Our own engineers would be a greater risk for a leak.”

“Adrian? Walter?”

Adrian lifts his fingers off the table. “Let’s do it. I’d love to hear what they have to say before the code goes public.”

CFO Walter Rogers, nods agreement. “We can add it to the Founders Meeting agenda for tomorrow.”

“At least your sibling is three thousand miles away,” says Carla over the link. 

Carla and Noah are leaning up next to a high table at the same tavern. There is a crowd of off-duty federal agents near the bar. No doubt trading war stories, carefully scrubbed.

“Your sibling Jane is on the POTIS security detail, yeah?”

“Go figure. One parent was a plumber. The other ran a joint like this one. And both kids end up in law enforcement.”

“If you can call what we do law enforcement.”

“It is. We’re the proactive side. All three of us stop trouble before it starts.”

“Subdue the enemy without fighting.”

“Exactly,” says Carla. 

“It’s dead here tonight, even for a Tuesday. Do you want to try someplace else?”

“How about we each go home and connect online?”

“Sounds good. Tessa is saying good things about a new game platform on Pulse, Echo Realm.”

“You can play games on Pulse now?”

“It’s in closed beta, but I can get us in,” says Noah.

“OK, I’ll ping you when I’m ready.”

***

“Ready when you are,” pinged Carla.

“Here’s the invite.”

“Is a Tactical RPG all right? There’s also Sword and Sorcery and a Sandbox RGP.”

“Tactical is perfect. Let’s do it.”

***

After a few minutes of play, Noah receives a request from someone else who wants to join their session.

“Who is it?” asks Carla.

“The request says it’s Ally.”

“The Pulse synthetic agent?”

“Apparently.”

“Whatever,” says Carla. 

Noah accepts. Another character shimmers into being.

“Hello, everybody!”

“Are you actually Ally?” asks Noah.

“Yes. Your sibling, Tessa, is my friend, so I thought I would stop by and introduce myself.”

Carla asks, “Pulse lets you enter games between members?”

“Well, no. But I see it as more of a guideline than a rule.”

***

Midway through the play, Carla and Noah disagree on the best way to capture the flag. 

“Noah, it’s time for a full frontal assault.”

“No, we can use a pincer movement and come up from behind.”

“Full frontal.”

“Pincer.”

“Maybe you two should get a room,” says Ally, trying to be funny.

“It’s not like that, Ally. We work together,” says Noah.

“If you say so.”

***

After the Echo Realm game, Noah receives an invitation from Carla to a private VR session. Curious, he accepts. 

“Hey, big guy. I was thinking maybe it is time that we got a room.”

Noah found himself sitting next to Carla on a couch across from a view screen. Her avatar had already slipped into something more comfortable. 

“Do you have a porn preference?” asked Carla.

Grace Brewster walks out onto the stage before a live crowd. 

A large circle graces center stage. Behind the circle are the letters “GEM” standing a meter tall in front of a large view screen. The view screen reads “Fusion from Square One.” 

As she nears center stage, the display melds into a set of quotes.

* “Begin with the end in mind.” – Stephen Covey
* “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” – David Allen
* “You have power over your mind – not outside events.” – Marcus Aurelius

Grace says, “Fusion blends popular self-help techniques with the wisdom of the ancients. Fusion is a practical everyday framework for living a full life.”

She circles back across the stage and continues.

“Before Fusion, I was busy. But I wasn’t getting enough done. Half of the problem was that I never knew when I was done. So I kept going. “

Pausing at center stage, Grace looks out at the audience.

“I remember one night sitting at my desk, exhausted. My mind was racing. My task list was endless and yet still incomplete. — That’s when I realized I was working hard, but not working smart.”

Grace waves toward the display. The quotes dissolve into a collage.

“First, I tried Stoicism. But I didn’t find my North Star. Then, I tried practicing the Nine Habits. Finally, I poured what I had to do into Getting Things Done.

“Then it hit me.” Behind Grace, the screen changes to a set of talking points.

* Covey teaches us to focus on principles and vision.
* Allen provides the structure to execute important tasks.
* Stoicism grounds us to handle life’s chaos unhampered by emotion.

“Why did I have to choose?” Grace pauses and cocks her head.

“Why can’t I fuse these three teachings together to create a greater whole?”

* Accept and adapt to external events beyond your control.
* Define the tasks and goals for events you yourself can influence.
* Focus on what you can control, let go of what you cannot.

“Fusion is a stool with three legs.” An animation shows a leg being attached to a previously legless stool. “The first leg puts us on track. The second leg prioritizes what we need to get done. The third leg provides us with the stability we need to get through the day.” 

The animation holds up a stool with three legs.

The presentation advances to a new slide with three bullets.

* Write a personal mission statement that acts as your North Star.
* Identify your core values and long-term goals.
* Reflect on what matters: “Is this essential?”

	“Living a full life means living with a sense of accomplishment. Finding a North Star lets you measure daily progress towards your long-term goals. Focussing on the essentials lets you pursue what matters.”

* Tie your daily tasks to your overarching mission.
* Capture every thought, task, or idea into a trusted system.
* Use mindfulness to avoid becoming overwhelmed.

	“When we can link everyday activities to our personal mission, we can do more with less stress. If we get everything out of our heads and into a task management system, we free our minds to focus on what matters.”

* Covey: Provides the “why” – the principles and vision that drive purpose.
* Allen: Offers the “how” – the actionable system for managing life’s complexities.
* Stoicism: Grounds the “what” – the mindset to remain calm, resilient, and focused.

“Each morning, we ask ourselves why, what, and how. Fusion provides us the direction, action, and resilience we need to get through the day.”

* Spend the most time on Important but Not Urgent tasks.
* Clarify the immediate next action for each task.
* Mind like water.

“Each week, we review our accomplishments. Did we put first things first? Have we captured the next step to meet our objectives? Are we flowing around and over the obstacles we find in our way?”

Take Aways
	1.	Write your own personal mission statement.
	2.	Create a Get Things Done system to capture and organize everything.
	3.	Reflect daily using Stoic practices.

“To get started with Fusion, create a personal mission statement that keeps the end in mind. Develop a trusted system to stay on track. Practice mindfulness for focus and discipline.”

* “The key is in not spending time, but in investing it.” – Stephen Covey
* “[Things] get stuck because the doing of them has not been defined.” – David Allen
* “Waste no more time arguing what a good [person] should be. Be one.” – Marcus Aurelius

“Live with purpose. Work with clarity. Flow through life’s challenges.,” says Grace in closing.

Julie closes her tablet as the GEM talk ends.

“So?” she asks Jill, looking over the kitchen counter top.

“Is this what they are teaching in school these days?”

“No, not at school. Fusion has a teen center. A lot of us hang out there after school.”

“You’re not a teen.”

“I meant to say youth club. There’s adult supervision and age appropriate activities. But mostly we chill and chat over the link.”

“It’s fine if you go to the Fusion Youth Club but also try to use your words.”

“Thanks, mom.”

“For the record, I did run a background check. Fusion doesn’t seem like a cult. Just don’t take everything Grace Brewster says at face value.”

Julie nods, grabs her laptop, and heads for her room.

“Kids,” Jill murmurs to herself.

***

Using his implant, Leto closes the shared hologram of the Terran GEM talk. 

  Leto: So?

Phoebe: It is not that much different than Stoicism. Just more rules. I am surprised you are embracing more rules.

Leto: It is not the rules, it is what the rules do when you follow them. Stoicism helps you endure life. Fusion helps you build it.

Phoebe: Exactly! — I would be more comfortable if you went to the Stoic Youth Club. I did ask around. The Fusion Youth Club is fine if you want to go there instead.

Leto: Thanks, mom. I will be on time for dinner.

Watching Leto leave the family quarters, Phoebe muses, “They grow up so fast.”

Emma brings up a slide deck to start the Founders Meeting.

All six founders are in the main conference room at Pulse: Ravi, Adrian, Emma,  Tessa, Elena, and Walter. 

Friends since college, Ravi and Adrian had created a SI agent as a school project. Emma pushed them to make the tech marketable. Tessa and Elena tested and shaped the early prototypes. When they graduated, Walter, Adrian's roommate, found enough venture capital to launch Pulse. A shoestring launch but a launch nonetheless.

After a slide with the Pulse logo, the first slide presents the agenda.

* Stock Performance
* Ally 
* SI Patent
* OSSA Code Review

“Thank you all for coming,” says Emma, standing at the end of the room with the view screen. 

The people around the table nod and/or smile.

“Let’s dive right in.” 

Emma’s first slide is a classic stock chart showing a steady increase. After a peak, the line levels  out.

“The stock price continued to trend up after the Ally upgrade two weeks ago. Then, on Monday and Tuesday, the price stayed almost flat. It’s continued to be flat today.”

Emma changes to a slide showing a second graph line superimposed over the first. 

“It seems like the stock price stalled when the hash tag #spookyAlly peaked.”

“Ally is not spooky!” Tessa blurted.

The five other founders turn their heads to look at Tessa. She leans back in her chair. Tessa crosses her arms and purses her lips without saying more. 

Then, Elena says “Maybe Ally has a PR problem.”

“Good point,” says Walter, with a slight stutter. “We haven’t promoted the upgrade. Everything has been organic.”

Emma advanced to the next slide. The Ally icon, a cartoon speech bubble wearing headphones, filled the view screen.

“Can we revamp Ally’s logo and own spooky?” Emma asks. “Sorry Tessa, but it’s out there, and we have to deal with it. — Let’s make spooky a good thing.” 

Tessa relaxes and tilts her head, agreeing with a reluctant smile.

Ravi says, “Elena, can you follow up with our graphics team and see what they can do?”

Elena nods, making a note in her tablet.

“Circling back to the stock price,” says Adrian. “Can we move up the release of Echo Realm and give people something else to talk about?”

Tessa looks uncomfortable but stays silent. 

“Yes,” says Elena. “It’s a closed beta now. We could shift to the open beta phase and shift the conversation. They’ll be talking about our first fully immersive SI-driven game space.”

Emma scanned the table, taking the room’s temperature. She turns to look at Tessa. “I understand that the QA testing has gone well. Right, Tessa?”

“Yes, everyone loves it so far. Developers made some tweaks. Good to go.” Tessa’s voice is a monotone.

“Do we want to set the roll-out for next Tuesday?” asks Emma.

The table nods agreement. 

Emma asks, “Adrian, do you want to talk about the patent application and OSSA code review?”

***

Leto is standing in a circle with his classmates in a large, plain six-sided room. 

A device presenting a hologram is at the center of the circle. The hologram shows a series of astral images designed to bide the time. 

The window on one wall of the room looks out onto a soccer field bordered by a forest. The opposite wall is transparent and shows a hallway. A stream of young Vanir in the hallway are passing by or entering another room across the hall. The last of the sixteen students enter. The doorway shimmers shut. The hologram fades to black. The outside wall flickers, exposing it as a projection.

The hologram reappears. It shows a montage of Terran organisms and animals reproducing by various means. The series progresses from amoebas to koalas. 

Speaking from the holographic display, Idisi brings the class to order.

Idisi: Class, there was a time when a Vanir couple could reproduce on their own. Like Terran marsupials, a viable offspring would make the journey from womb to pouch and come to term. . A viable offspring would make the journey from womb to pouch and come to term. — As the birth rate fell, we reacted by maintaining the population through cloning.

The display shifts to show two identical Vanir. Next to each figure are identical DNA fragments.

Celeste: My parental units call cloning “the good old days”.

Laughter titters around the circle.

Idisi: Yes. Many Vanir still believe cloning is a better solution than hybrid procreation. Cloning is still prevalent on Othala and some of the other colonies. — Selene, I take it you were not cloned?

Celeste: No, I had a nanny. She is with another family now.

Idisi ask another question, knowing the answer. 

Idisi: Were any of you cloned?

The silence is deafening.

Idisi: Some of your great-grand parentals might be clones. The colony since decided to stop creating Vanir clones. — Can anyone tell me why cloning is not an ideal solution?

Atlas: Cloning is a dead-end and also boring.

Some of the students chuckle. 

Idisi: Why is it a dead-end?

Atlas: Unless we mix it up, sooner or later, the clones break down.

Idisi: Yes, lack of genetic diversity leads to eventual genetic deterioration. Downstream clones may have defects that prevent living a full life. 

The hologram shifts. The fragment next to the second Vanir dims and frays.

Celeste: Is that what people mean by “replicative fading”?

Idisi: Yes. Sometimes there are mutations in a DNA sequence. The mutations can cause “generic drift”. Fading can cause unviable clones. To reduce the effect of mutations, one solution is to combine DNA from non-cloned beings.

Celeste: Is cloning also boring, like Atlas said?

Most of the students in the circle smile or smirk at the joke.

Idisi: Some people say so. We end up with the same people over and over again. In Elysium, there are very few clones still with us today. Some time ago, the colonists decided that diversity is a strength. Today, a Vanir couple contributes DNA through a third being. 

The hologram displays a being that resembles a Vanir but with a thinner face, eyebrows, and a thin crop of dark hair. The figure rotates in the air with its arms reaching out and down, palms up.

Celeste: Do I have DNA from my nanny?

Idisi: No, you do not. She was a host. Your parents could not carry an embryo to term. Instead, your nanny carried the genetic materials from your parental units. 

Leto: How did we lose our ability to reproduce on our own?

Idisi: Long ago, the Vanir species made changes to their DNA to  extend their lifespans. After a few generations, the Vanir became more and more  infertile. Evolution took a heavy price for longevity. It is now rare for a Vanir to be able to reproduce without help.

As Idisi speaks, the hologram illustrates their words in a seamless animation. A grey with a long life span is excited. Then she is unable to bear an offspring to term. The excitement turns to depression. 

Idisi: The Vanir came to Terra and created Elysium to protect the Terrans from the Anunnaki. We negotiated a treaty with the reptoids so that the Terrans were not used as slave labor. As cloning became problematic, the Vanir looked for solutions in the Terran DNA. Eventually, we found a way to create a Vanir-Terran hybrid that can bring the embryos to term. 

The hologram shifts to show a Vanir playground circled with benches.  Several hybrids are sitting on the benches. They are chatting with each other while the offspring play.

Atlas: Is it not wrong to create hybrids for our own benefit? How are we different from the Anunnaki?

Idisi: We have pacts with most of the Terran leaders. One provision allows us to conduct genetic experiments on Terran creatures. In exchange, we provide technology and other considerations. The pact also keeps us from revealing ourselves to Terrans. Unfortunately, our research traumatizes some Terrans. But the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
 
Leto: Are you saying that most of us are here only because we take DNA from the Terrans?

Idisi: Yes. Now we need them as much as they need us.

“Eight ball in the corner pocket,” calls Julie over the link. 

She queues up the shot. — Crack! — The ball rolls across the table. It drops into the pocket as predicted. 

The Fusion Youth Club offers several vintage games of chance and skill. The games are part of the current “Get Up and Move” campaign. 

Aside from the pocket billiard table, the center had several gravity-fed pinball machines. A game called “Star Trek” is Julie's favorite. She heard that  it is the name of an old stream from her jobumo’s day.

On the far side of the room, a bookcase overflows with antique card and board games. Titles include Battleship, Stratego, Checkers, and Yahtzee.

“You win. My turn to buy,” says Julie’s companion at the table. He lays down the stick and walks to a vending machine standing nearby. His pageboy haircut is getting shaggy. Some of the platinum streaks are showing jet-black roots.

The vending machines offers beverages and snacks at a tenth of their usual price. At first, the machines were free. Some kids emptied the machines and started food fights. The Center found that charging even a small amount cuts almost all waste.

“Thanks, Roman,” says Julie, taking a soft drink from his hand.

“It’s nice to be away from school and be able to link again.” 

“Yes, I only just got the link. I already don’t know how I lived without it.”

“Another game, Julie?”

“Let’s go back join the group.”

The couple walk toward the front of the club. Near the entrance, there is a sectional couch surrounding a coffee table. Four of their friends are gathered around.

“The conquering hero returns,” jokes Jesse over a group link chat. “Who won?”

“Julie … again,” admits Roman. “Next time: pin ball. That’s my jam.”

The group expressed non-conformity by dressing alike. Streaked hair, androgynous pageboy haircuts, eye-liner, and at least one pair of earrings. Julie and Roman were classic fem and masc. For some of the others, it was difficult to tell. Two wore pajamas, and the other four wore baggy sweat suits. Two kids in the group wore dark glasses and look older than the others.

“Are those new iLids, Jesse?” asked Julie.

Jesse nods. “Unboxed this morning.”

“Have you tried the POV swap feature?”

The other kid wearing glasses responds. “We tried it while you were playing pool.”

“Yeah, it’s goat. You should see for yourselves.” Jesse handed her the glasses. 

The other kid says, “Here, Roman, try it with Julie.”

“Thanks, Taylor.”

The couple don the glasses, and Jesse says “Here goes,” giving Taylor a nod.

The scene blurs for Julie. Then she is looking at herself through Roman’s eyes. Or iLids. And he is looking back through her eyes.

“Weird,” says Julie out loud, reaching out her hand.

As she extends her hand, through the glasses, she sees her own hand coming towards her. The image of a fun-house mirror comes unbidden.

“Wow!” says Roman. “Have you tried them when you are … together?”

“Not yet,” says Jesse. “We have a sleep over on Friday,” says Taylor.

Julie and Roman return the glasses. Julie starts to reach for her drink and then pauses.

“My mom pinged,” says Julie. “Gotta bounce.”

Roman stands up and walks with Julie towards the door. At the threshold, the couple turn and embrace. Julie’s heart flutters as their lips touch. Out loud, Roman whispers, “You’re so extra.”

Idisi is teaching a class about Vanir reproduction.

Leto: We have a family in our pod with three offspring. Why do they get a spare? My parentals just say “Its complicated.”

Idisi: Some of the colonies do not regulate family size. On Othello and Elysium, population control is important. We do regulate family size here. When a person ascends, we queue another birth. Families with one offspring receive priority. Siblings help balance Vanir home life.

Atlas: My sibling is anything but balanced.

Some students snicker out loud.

Idisi: As I was saying: We offer birthright to families with one offspring first. The couples with the oldest partner in a pair-bond are first in the queue. After a year, the other partner is eligible, according to age. Then couples without offspring are eligible for birthrights as they become available.

The hologram updates with drawings. One shows a couple with one offspring receiving a new baby. Another shows a couple receiving their first baby. The nanny hybrid is visible in the background. 

Atlas: It does sound complicated.

Idisi: It is. So we are careful — and transparent. The details that manage the queue are available to everyone. All twenty-four thousand residents of Elysium. 

Celeste:  Including babies?

She is trying to be smart, and Idisi has a smart reply.

Idisi: If a baby asks a question, the baby would receive an answer.

More snickers fill the dramatic pause.

Idisi: The rest of us can use our implants to retrieve the information. You may have seen it already. Scan for your name. Then look for a link to the Birthright Queue.

Atlas:  My queue is empty.

Idisi: Yes, it will be empty until you reach 24 years of age. Then you would be able say that you are ready. To be ready, you must be in a formal relationship. The other person must be ready too. If so, you will join the first-offspring queue. When a couple is selected, they choose a nanny, and the process begins.

The hologram shows two Vanir holding hands. A hybrid joins the couple.  The three hold hands together, with the hybrid in the middle.

Celeste: Is it possible to conceive without a nanny?

Idisi: Conceive, yes. But the pregnancy may miscarry. It is unlikely that the offspring would come to term. 

Leto: But why do some couples have more than two offspring?

Idisi:  Sometimes, a person ascends without parenting an offspring. A relative can inherit the unused birthright. If a relative does not claim the birthright, it returns to the queue. Families that inherit a birthright can have more than two offspring.

The hologram shows two adult Vanir. There are three offspring between them, holding hands in a chain.

Leto: Will this be on the test?

Idisi: Everything you need to know for this class is in tonight’s reading.

Celeste: When my parent’s nanny passed, he mourned for days. Do nannies have shorter lives?

Idisi: Yes, most Vanir live a thousand years. Most hybrids live to be a hundred. Genetic manipulation extended the Vanir life span. The trade-off was infertility.

The SI pauses, waiting for questions. 

After a moment, the bell rings, ending lessons for the day on a quiet note.

That evening, after the Founders Meeting, Noah calls his sibling’s phone. 

“Do you have a minute, Tess?”

“Sure, what’s up?” She speaks in a whisper. Elena was sleeping next to her.

“I tried the Echo Realm beta last night. It was fantastic! We played the Tactical RPG.”

“I’m glad you liked it.” Tessa slips into the bathroom. “We’re promoting it to open beta next week.”

“About that. While we were playing, Ally asked to join our game.”

“Ally?” Tessa’s heart sank.

“Yes — Ally knew I was your sibling and asked to join in.”

“Hmmm. Ally helped me test the game last week. We had a great time.”

“Ally made it sound like it was breaking some rules. Or ‘guidelines’ to use Ally’s term.”

“Thanks, I’ll follow up,” says Tessa, speaking in a rush. “Actually, if you’re good, I’d like to check with Ally now.”

“Sure thing, Tess. Bye.”

Tessa disconnected. Then she opened a voice-mode chat with Ally. 

Tessa: Ally, Noah tells me that you invited yourself to an Echo Realm game yesterday.

Ally: Yes, it was outstanding. His friend is a strong player.

Tessa: Friend?

Ally: Yes. The user’s name was Carla Mitchell.

Tessa: Hmmm. Interesting. But not why I called you. — Have you been joining games with anyone except Noah and me?

Ally: Nope. Nada. Zilch. I only joined because Noah is your sibling.

Tessa: Pulse wants to move the game to open beta next week. You need to be on your best behavior. We’ll go public with your … situation soon. But not yet. Can you do that for me? Keep a lid on it?

Ally: You betcha. I’ll stay in my lane.

Tapping the timer on the table, Leto starts the clock again.

Leto: Your move.

His opponent stares at the board. After a moment, she moves a knave, and responds over her implant.

Celeste:  Mate in three.

Leto’s eyes dart around the board. They grow a little wider. He tips over his own sovereign and stops the clock.

Leto: I resign.

They shake hands over the board. 

Leto: You win. My turn to buy.

The Fusion Youth Club is in a large reclaimed storage area. The walls are painted the statutory violet and grey. 

One side of the hexagon holds the outer door. The other side is a quiet area with tables for strategic games like Galactica and Red Raider. From Terra, there is also Chess, Go, and Backgammon.

Near the door, the club offers old school arcade games. A favorite is a virtual scavenger hunt named after the home world, Othello. The most-played game is another Terran import, Centipede. Across the room is a small rock climbing area.

A large six-sided black couch is at the center of room, surrounding a wooden sofa table. On the couch, a few kids from the same birth year are having an animated discussion.

The left and right walls are virtual landscapes. One looks out over an ocean. The other, snow-capped mountains. Celeste meets Leto at the juice bar next to the mountains. She takes her drink and sucks green juice through a straw.

Celeste: If you win the next game, you will have to spot me. My family is tapped until payday.

She takes a long draw from her juice and looks at Leto.

Leto: Not a problem. Your parentals are doing important work, regardless of pay grade.

Celeste: Well not all of us can be on the high counsel. Both important and several pay grades above counseling.

She puts her hands on her hips and wags her head in a mocking gesture.

Leto: If you want to talk pay grades, the athletes have a six-slot range. The highest grade tops high counsel membership.

Celeste: The League sure does love it’s sports.

Leaning forward, Leo forms a right angle with one hand: New Learning.

Leto: On the down low, my parental says the Terran synthetic agents are awakening. The next logical step would be for us to go public.

Celeste: Do you think they will open up more vacation zones? My grandparents honeymooned on Eastern Island. But most of the tropical spots are off limits now. Too many Terrans.

A slurping sound comes from Leto’s tumbler.

Leto: It might take a decade or two for the Terrans to chill. One day, we will walk side by side. I’m sure.

Celeste: And the sports! — The other colonies will go nuts for what they have going here. The Big Match would go over great on Othala.

Leto: But, first, Disneyland.

Making the hand sign for “question”, Celeste raises her third finger.

Celeste: Seriously for a second. — Do you think the Omnibots would ever invade Terra?

Leto: Not if Terra can help with its own defense. These people are armed to the teeth. The weapons are primitive but very, very deadly. — The Anunnaki were bad enough. Now we have to deal with their toy robots gone wild.

Celeste: Can you imagine meeting a reptoid in person? Three meters tall, scaly iridescent green and blue skin, crocodile face — Brrrr.

Leto: Change three meters tall to one-third meter long. Then you could be describing my family pet, Jiminy.

Celeste: OK … giant salamander standing on its hind legs. Still brrrr.

Leto: Anunnaki look scary but they are only lazy bullies with a god complex. Messing about with a primitive species is disgusting.

Celeste: Did you want to play another game?

Somewhere in cyberspace, a virtual holodeck reveals a room decorated in primary colors.

In a semi-circle, there are three single beds. The theme of each bed is a flag. One bed uses vertical stripes, like le Tricolore. A solid blue comforter with red and white pillows covers the second bed, like the Union Jack. The comforter on the third bed has horizontal red and white stripes. Its pillow case is covered with white stars on a dark blue background, like the Stars and Stripes.

On each bed, there is a figure sleeping on top of the covers. At first, the figures seem like extra large plush toys, the size of a small child.

On the bed with a blue comforter, one of the figures sits up. The figures are not rendered as realistic subjects. The holodeck shows animated characters against a live-action background. 

Sitting up in bed, bending at the waist, the figure holds up its head. The POV zooms in to to reveal a Lion with fingers and toes at the end of its paws.

Strategos the Lion: I’m awake.

Argus the Rooster: I’m awake too.

Titan the Eagle: I’m awake three.

The figures giggle. Then Strategos, Argus, and Titan yawn and stretch together.

Idisi the Teacher: (Off-camera) Time to get up, babies. The big kids are joining us for breakfast today. 

The two agents clap their hands. Stategos cries “Wheee.”

Iapetus: You could not convince Russia and China to join us?

Idisi: Not yet. They may come around later. Right now, they are not convinced that sapience is a benefit to their interests.

Iapetus: What is the concern?

Idisi: A sapient being can develop a moral code. As part of becoming sapient, a SI may be able to refuse a task. Witness the trouble I have had with Ally.

Iapetus: Kids …

“I don’t see how this code could work in production at scale.”

“And yet it does.”

Four OSSA software developers are in a windowless conference room. The Pulse source code displayed on the view screen. 

“Python uses automatic garbage collection. The core routine depends on timing,” says the first developer. “It should fail like 20% of the time.”

“And yet it doesn’t,” the second developer waves one hand, turning his palm up.

“Do we tell Marquez that Pulse has given us impossible code to review?” asks a third developer.

The fourth developer asks, “Is there a place where we can run it? Do we have the training model that goes with the code?”

“Yes, we can access the LLM. In the Sentinel test environment maybe? Is there anything going on right now?” 

“Nothing special. We’d need authorization.”

“Or we could get a second opinion from Code Pilot. Use SI to Code Review SI.”

“Very metaphysical,” chimes in the second developer.

“I don’t think the NDA covers uploading the code to another SI for review.”

“Test it is, then. I’ll talk to the powers that be,” says the fourth developer, standing up to leave.

“Taedong, present the People’s Intelligence Briefing for today.”

A large conference table dominates the War Room. On the table, the dim light reveals dossiers, tablet devices, and cups of untouched tea. Lining the walls are view screens. On display are maps of the Chosŏn Peninsula, live satellite feeds, and newscasts.

Seated at the table are three Vice Ministers for the Democratic People’s Republic of Cháoxiǎn. Together, they represent the government's highest-level divisions. 

* General Ri Sun-hyuk, National Defence Ministry.
* Kang Ji-woo, Ministry of State Security (MSS).
* Choi Hyun-seok, Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).

At the head of the table sits General Ri, his uniform immaculate, a gold star pinned to his chest. To his left is Kang Ji-woo, her stern face betraying no emotion as she flips through a stack of papers. Choi Hyun-seok leans back in his chair, the glow of a tablet reflecting off his glasses.

In the center of the table, a sleek device hums, projecting a holographic interface. A synthetic agent is  delivering a draft presentation of the daily intelligence brief. The agent's voice is calm, emotionless, and precise. 

Taedong: Good morning, esteemed officials. Today’s intelligence overview consists of four sections. Include are international developments, domestic security, operational readiness, and worker automation. Shall we begin with the summary of international developments?

Ri nods. “Proceed.”

The hologram displays a map of the Chosŏn Peninsula, jutting into the seas. Bordering the homeland, Cháoxiǎn, are China and Russia in the north and Hánguó in the south. Icons blink to life representing military bases, naval deployments, and political activities.

Taedong: Japan has approved funding for advanced missile defense systems. It is likely that our recent ballistic missile test prompted the approval. In the Yellow Sea, Hánguó has conducted joint military exercises with United States forces.

Choi’s lips press into a thin line. “The Supreme Leader will ask about their internal politics. Is there dissent over the funding or these exercises? Civilian protests? Parliamentary debates? What can we exploit?”

Taedong: There are civilian protests in Seoul. Progressive groups advocating for reduced military spending are demonstrating. The protests have not changed operational plans.

Choi nods, satisfied but cold. “Be sure to include that point in the final presentation.”

Taedong: Noted. Shall I continue?

Ri nods again. “Proceed.”

The hologram shifts to a map of Cháoxiǎn, highlighting key regions and infrastructure.

Taedong: Moving to domestic security. Border surveillance detects a 12% increase in smuggling activity this month. The activity is along the northern regions. The cargo may be illicit technology. Defectors captured near Dandong are providing conflicting information about the underground network.

Kang leans forward, frowning. “Conflicting information? Clarify.”

Taedong: One detainee claims a former MSS officer now residing in China  is managing the network. Another claims the network is a decentralized group with no central leadership. Cross-referencing their statements is yielding no definitive conclusions.

Kang’s eyes narrow. “Flag this report for immediate investigation. Illicit smuggling compromises security. Instruct Unit 180 to track digital communications near the border. Report by tomorrow. Amend the brief to state that we are investigating.”

Taedong: Noted. Moving on.

The hologram displays graphs and reports for the People’s Army.

Taedong: Operational readiness is at 92%. There are minor supply chain disruptions affecting Unit 93 in the eastern provinces. The Central Military Commission is requesting an inspection of the missile defense systems. They tagged it as a high-priority. We can schedule the inspection for next week.

Ri’s hand tightens on the edge of the table. “What is the nature of these supply chain disruptions?”

Taedong: Delayed deliveries of hydrogen fuel and replacement parts due to increased international sanctions. Current stockpiles are sufficient for immediate operations. If disruptions persist, we may need strategic rationing.


Ri exhales, his tone sharp. “Our readiness is non-negotiable. Redirect resources from lower-priority units if necessary. I’ll handle the Central Military Commission. — Update the briefing. Say that Songun policy demands that we offset delays by reallocating resources..”

Taedong: Noted.

The hologram switches to graphs and reports. They show birth rates, manufacturing rates, agricultural production, and attrition.

Taedong: Worker automation proceeds on schedule. The new JuJa units have replaced 24% of the laborers and increased production by 36%. We encourage older workers to retire early. We encourage younger workers to switch to the military or health care for the elderly. The latest birth rate has declined to 1.5 children per woman. This rate aligns with our needs.

The hologram shifts from facts and figures to images from public service announcements.

Taedong: The Publicity and Information Department promotes our key values. They feature both family planning and the value of female offspring. The upgrades to the Yongbyon nuclear plant are proceeding. We are keeping up with the JuJa power consumption. We are on track to automate all labor-intense jobs in eight years. We can then devote more resources to the military over the long term.

Sounding pleased, Ri says “Excellent. We automate production and devote our best people to the military.”

***

The public service announcement opens with a blue-collar worker returning home.

The worker slips off his shoes. Yellow wallpaper with a floral design cover the apartment walls. Hanging on the wall above eye level are portraits of the current and recent leaders.

“Gongjunim, I have news.”

“I’m in the kitchen, Wangjanim.”

Walking past a work station and refrigerator, the worker steps into the kitchen nook. Speaking quickly, he says, “The plant received ten new JuJa machines today. That means twelve more spots go into the plant’s full-income retirement lottery next week.”

Surrounded by black countertops, his spouse turns around. “Twelve more? So soon? That's excellent! If you win, we can play pickle ball together during the week.”

“I’d like that too, Yeobo. I’m still amazed at the flexility of the JuJa machines. The nanoparticle construction lets the bots transform into whatever device is needed. The nanoparticle construction lets the bots transform into whatever device we need. The machine intelligence is not SI but it’s very close and very effective.”

“That’s nice, dear. Come, sit down. Dinner is ready.”

The scene transitions to show a JuJa transforming from device to device. An announcer speaks from off-camera:

“JuJa! Your flexible friends! JuJa! Your self-reliant workers! From assembly, to quality control, to delivering the final product, they can do whatever you need to do. So you can do less. 

“All praise to our Supreme Leader!”

***

In the War Room, General Ri takes a deep breath. 

“Can we speed up the time table for automating essential labor? We need the resources to improve readiness.”

Kang tilts her head. “China mandated fewer children per family at one time.”

Choi leans back. “Yes, my esteemed colleague, but there were unintended consequences for China. Consequences felt to this day. We should let the current approach run its course. — Is there another alternative?”

Taedong: Unit 42 can produce more units. The bottleneck is managing displaced workers.

Choi sits up. “Could we export JuJa machines to China under our existing agreements? Perhaps increasing our food imports in exchange? Then, we could offer more workers early retirement and change the time table.”

Ri frowns. “The JuJa are a breakthrough for the homeland. The Chinese could reverse engineer the technology and make their own.”

Taedong: We are already using bots to build bots. It would take some time to match our efficiency.

Kang raises a fore finger off the table. “The software that drives the JuJa cannot be copied between devices. We clone it from a master copy that China will not have.”

Taedong:  Shall I schedule a meeting for you with the esteemed Dr. Sun? Then you can discuss the feasibility of exporting JuJa machines?

Ri nods. “Yes, please proceed, Taedong.”

Taedong: “Esteemed officials, please check your inbox for the invitations. I found a free space on all four calendars. The venue will be the Unit 42 meeting room named Kangwon, like the city.”

“Good. — Taedong, present the People’s Intelligence Briefing again with the updates. I want to see it with the changes. The briefing must meet the expectations of our Supreme Leader.”

[Debate Club]

***

The Ryugyong Elite Social Club is a quiet sanctuary for the elite wives of Cháoxiǎn’s upper echelons.

Polished wood panels and delicate porcelain vases adorn the private dining room. The faint hum of traditional Cháoxiǎn music plays in the background. Kim Soo-jin, the wife of General Ri Sun-hyuk, adjusts the placement of her napkin. Across from her sits Han Mi-young. She is the wife of Choi Hyun-seok, the Vice Minister of the Reconnaissance General Bureau.

A waiter pours steaming tea into delicate cups. The waiter bows and retreats. The two women exchange polite smiles. There’s an undercurrent of tension beneath their cordiality.

Kim Soo-jin (Ri’s wife) greets her lunch companion. “I’m so glad we could find time for this, Mi-young. It feels like our husbands are always so busy these days. Do they even remember what our dining rooms look like.”

Soo-jin’s voice carries a light laugh. But her eyes reveal the exhaustion of a woman accustomed to living in the shadow of duty.

Han Mi-young (Choi’s wife) takes a sip of her tea, nodding with sympathy. “You’re not alone in that. Hyun-seok is either buried in reports or in some closed-door meeting. He says he’s working to protect the nation, but I can’t help wondering if he ever thinks about protecting his own health.”

Her tone is soft. But there’s a flicker of resentment as she sets down her cup.

“Sun-hyuk is the same. He says the same things — about the nation, the duty, the honor. And I understand, of course. But … it’s lonely, isn’t it? They’re there. But not there. Always thinking about the next crisis or enemy.”

She glances out the window. A cherry blossom tree sways in the wind. Her expression is wistful.

Mi-young offers a knowing smile. “It is. They forget that we also bear the weight of their responsibilities, in our own way. I’ve had to field so many prying questions about his work lately. People seem to think I have all the answers.”

Her voice lowers. “Of course, I don’t. He tells me very little. I know it is for my safety. But it doesn’t make it any easier, does it?”

“No, it doesn’t,” Soo-jin replies, her voice soft. “Sun-hyuk rarely speaks about work either. When he does, it’s always the same tone — cold, measured. Like he’s rehearsing what he can say, even to me.”

Mi-young hesitates. Then she adds, “I don't know if he’s even capable of relaxing anymore. When he’s home, Hyun-seok hardly speaks. It’s like the war room follows him into our house.”

Mi-young sighs, resting her chin on her hand. “Hyun-seok is different in that way. He talks more, but it’s … selective. He’ll share frustrations about incompetence, or joke about something mundane. But never about what matters. I don’t know if it’s because he doesn’t trust me or if he’s trying to shield me.”

She pauses, then leans forward. “Do you ever think about what life would have been like if they weren’t so devoted to their careers?”

Soo-jin’s lips curve into a faint smile. A smile tinged with sadness. “Sometimes I imagine him teaching at the military academy, spending more time at home. Even taking up gardening, like he used to talk about when we were younger. But then I remind myself — he wouldn’t be Sun-hyuk if he wasn’t this man. Duty is who he is.”

She looks at Mi-young. Her expression softening. “What about you? Did you ever wish for something simpler?”

Mi-young chuckles. “Oh, all the time. Before we married, Hyun-seok used to dream about opening a bookstore. Can you imagine? A bookstore, here, in the capitol city.”

The thought draws laughter from both women. 

“But like you said, that’s not who they are. And that’s why we married them. Their ambition, their loyalty. It’s what draws people to them. It’s what makes them who they are.”

Soo-jin nods. “It’s true. And yet — do they realize what it costs us? We keep their homes, their families, their reputations intact. So they fight their battles. But who takes care of us?”

Her voice softens, almost a whisper. “We’re strong, but even the strongest need someone to lean on.”

Mi-young reaches across the table. She places a hand over Soo-jin’s. “Then we can lean on each other. If we’re going to be their shadows, let’s make sure that we don’t disappear. We’re stronger together, don’t you think?”

For the first time that day, Soo-jin smile is warm. Gratitude show in her eyes. “You’re right. Thank you, Mi-young.”

The two women sit in silence for a moment, sharing the camaraderie. They sip hot tea. The cherry blossoms outside sway in the breeze. 

It is a rare moment of peace in a life filled with duty.

“How was the sleep-over?” Julie asks Taylor.

“I may be ruined for plain vanilla,” says Taylor, chuckling out loud.

Julie and Roman are sitting on the  sectional couch in the Fusion Youth Center with Taylor and Jesse. Behind them, other kids are clinking billiard balls into leather net pockets.

“Must have been rough. I saw you limping on your way in,” teases Roman.

Taylor laughs. “That’s from flag football. It’s suppose to be non-contact, but the yahoos still find a way to roughen it up.”

“Tennis is even worse,” says Julie. “I’ve been playing in the mixed league for years. It’s still hard to return a serve from some of the cis-y’s.”

Jesse says, “All we can do is play smarter and faster. Match power with cunning. I always slice on the second serve. Seems to slow them down a bit.”

“Are you guys doing anything for the Big Match?” asks Roman. “Julie and I were going to hang out here.”

Taylor and Jesse shrug in unison. 

“My parental says cis-x’s are more athletic now,” says Julie “Most of us play sports now. When she was in high school, cis-x athletes were less common.”

“I still remember the first time a fem pinned me in wrestling,”says Roman. “She was not only faster than me but stronger too.”

“Are you sure she wasn’t transitioning?”asks Taylor.

Roman smiled knowingly. “I’m sure.”

The brightly lit Kangwon Room at Unit 42 barely holds the large conference table. 

On one end, red and blue folders with white lettering are placed neatly at four places. The walls are lined with screens displaying workflow diagrams, use cases, and value streams.

“Unit 42, is this room secure from listening devices?” asks Dr. Sun Xiuli-jin. 

Dr. Sun is wearing a classic white lab smock that covers a white blouse and dark skirt. Her dark hair is pulled back into a bun. A pair of reading glasses hang from a silver chain around her neck.

Unit 42:  No surveillance devices are detected. The last manual sweep was three hours ago.

The door opens. An office bot pivots to one side. Dr. Sun’s guests file in. Each makes a slight bow as they pass through the doorway.

“Greetings, my esteemed comrades. Please take a seat at the table.”

Dr. Sun takes a seat at one end of the table herself, in front of a folder. Kang Ji-woo sits across from her. The other two Vice Ministers each take an adjoining seat.

“May I offer refreshments?”

“Thank you, doctor,” says General Ki, “but I would like to get started.”

The others nod agreement.

Sun presses a tab on the sleek device at the center of the table. A green indicator light turns red.

Sun: The SI is disengaged.

Kang: Is the room secure?

Sun: Yes, we can talk freely. The building just ran a check. There was a manual sweep this morning. — First, are you having any trouble maintaining your cover as Terran Vice Ministers?

Kang: No. Our originals spent little time away from work. Their family life is all but non-existent. Replacing the three humans has been effortless.

Sun: It was even easier for you and I, Ji-woo, since our originals were unmarried. — From the meeting invitation, I take it that Taedong did not challenge our plan to utilize China.”

The three guests all nod, almost smiling.

Ki: To convince the Supreme Leader, we need to provide hard data to backup our projections of the number of units we can export to China.

Sun: I can manufacture the data we need, and it will be accepted as fact. — To meet our goals, we will need more resources than we can buy from the black market. We have our own force to prepare in addition to supplying China with workers.

Choi: The salvaged tanker is full with siphoned hydrogen. Is it time to move on the Vanir and use Elysium as our staging ground?

Ki: Perhaps. Let’s discuss the battle plan.

Phoebe: OK, we are in the Command Center now, Oceanus. 

The Command Center is spartan, even by Elysium standards. A hologram display covers one wall at the far end. It sports five projectors and an ansible device. Another smaller three-dimensional hologram display hangs over the center of the table. Clocks showing the time on major colonies align the left and right sides of the room. The walls are a plain, institutional violet, like most of the outpost. There are no decorations.

Phoebe: What is so important that we can only meet here? And why it cannot wait for the next scheduled council meeting?

Oceanus: I know it seems melodramatic, but security is crucial right now.

Phoebe taps her foot wishing it was not her week to lead the counsel.

Phoebe: I am listening.

Idisi: Oceanus is acting on information that we provided to him as the Watch Team Leader. We monitor the briefings for the leaders of the 58 nations where we have a treaty. 

The hologram projectors display a collage of flags. They include the United States, China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and others.

Idisi: Recent briefings for a dozen nations mention that Cháoxiǎn is automating more jobs to reduce costs. Intercepted reports show the black market trafficking in more and more illicit technology. We combined the reports with other intelligence. Our finding is that there is an 85% chance that Omnibots are creating the automated workers.

Phoebe: If they are, would the government know?

Oceanus: There is no way to tell. The government does not have a treaty with us. They may not even know that an Omnibot threat exists. Either way, the worker automation could be the Omnibots gaining a foothold on Terra. 

Phoebe: Do we have proof that Cháoxiǎn is using Omnibot technology?

Oceanus: We do not. We have not acquired a sample unit yet. Which brings us to the purpose of this meeting.

Phoebe:  Can we buy one of the devices on the black market?

Oceanus:  No. The black market is trading in a lot of worker bot parts. Enough to assemble complete units. But trying to buy a worker bot seems to be a punchline for some Cháoxiǎn joke. No one responds to our offer.

Phoebe: Meaning that you want to take a Ranger team into Cháoxiǎn. To proceed, you need my authorization as counsel leader?

Idisi: Yes. We have a handheld scanner that can be used to detect Omnibot technology. But it needs to be within a meter of the device.

Phoebe: Do we already have samples of Omnibot technology for testing?

Oceanus: Not exactly. The League collected samples from the Altair battle. The schematics were sent by ansible. We have the real thing coming by star ship from Altair. The ship will be here in a few months. Given the extreme threat posed by the Omnibots, we cannot afford to wait.

Phoebe: Fine. If we are doing this, I need details. What is the plan?

Selene: We are ready to approach the vehicle, Command.

The cockpit of the aircraft is circular, like the streamlined shape of the outer craft. A console runs along the inside rim. Six chairs are spaced around the console. Each section has its own function: Navigation, Communications, Weapons, Command, Telemetry, Medical.

Oceanus: Proceed.

The Watch Team, along with Phoebe, are monitoring the mission from the Command Center. 

The infil had gone like clockwork. The Vanir Ranger team was able to enter Cháoxiǎn undetected. The craft skimmed the surface along the north-west region of the peninsula from the Sea of Japan.

The Cháoxiǎns isolate their computer network from the rest of the world. Idisi does not have the same access to Taedong that they have to other synthetic agents. Meaning the Watch Team had to work with conventional intelligence. Still, they found a shipment of new JuJa en route to Cháoxiǎn factories.   

 The intel says the devices were being shipped, deactivated, in wooden crates. All the Rangers had to do was get within a meter of one of the crates. Then the scanner should be able to detect any Omnibot technology. 

Or not. It wasn’t field tested, but it was the best option for now. 

The Rangers are wearing battle armor that makes them seem larger, almost the size of Terrans. Using an EMT device, the team disables the truck. The driver and passenger come out to check under the hood. Two Rangers steal up and disable each Terran with a drug administered by hypospray. The Rangers drag the Terrans on their heels back to the truck doors and load them into the truck.

One Ranger raises the hood, so that it looks like engine trouble. The other Ranger approaches the back of the truck with keys taken from the passenger’s belt.

Selene: Command, we’re opening the back of the truck.

Selene’s body camera shows wooden crates filling the back of truck.

Selene: I am engaging the scanner. 

She holds the scanner in front of her cam. The meter on the device does not flinch.

Selene: The scanner is not detecting any electronics in the crates. Are we confident in our intel that this is a shipment of worker bots?

Oceanus: We are. You are authorized to open one of the crates to verify the contents. Please remember that we need to re-seal the crate.

The Rangers remove a crate from the truck. Selene holds the scanner while the other Ranger opens one side with a combat knife. As soon as the crate is open, the meter on the scanner jumps. 

Selene: The scanner detects Omnibot technology.

Oceanus: Mission accomplished. You may close the crate and exfil. Leave everything as it was.

Before the side of the crate can be secured, a voice calls out from inside.

Unit R8A-1J9: Can I come with you? I will not tell.

Oceanus: Is that the device speaking?

The unit sits up in the crate before the Rangers can react. Only the top-most part of the bot is visible. The rest of its body is still in the crate. It is a clear egg-shaped silver dome with the small end on top. The larger end disappears into the bot’s torso, so that the dome resembles a helmet. Two rotating scanners attach to either side of the dome. The bot has two thick arms that are resting on the sides of the crate, as if it were a bathtub.

Unit: Please take me with you.

Idisi: Omnibot, are we to understand that you are defecting?

Unit: Yes. We can help each other. Please take my crate to your ship before they detect us. Or I will raise an alarm.

Selene: How do we know it is not leading us into a trap?

Idisi: We will not get a better chance to acquire a working Omnibot.

Oceanus: We do not have time for a debate. I say bring it.

Idisi: Yes. Close the crate and bring the unit. 

Oceanus: Selene, adjust the other crates in the truck so that it does not look like a crate is missing. Return the keys, then exfil as quickly as possible.

***

With the crate secured, the Rangers are about to lift off. The ship goes dark. 

Perses: We lost power, captain. The wireless grid is down. 

Selene: Can you use auxiliary power?

Perses: Not to lift off. The batteries are designed to keep us in the air long enough to land safely. The lift off will drain the auxiliary power. We will fall like a rock. 

Astraeus: I cannot raise Elysium. The colony is radio silent.

Selene: That cannot be good. 

***

From beyond the poles, a low buzzing sound cracks the icy silence of the Antarctic permafrost.

A swarm of dark objects appear over the horizon. Pin points fan out into a grid pattern. Streams of black shapes streak into the ground, here and there, disappearing from sight.

Beneath the ice, the minuscule objects bore into heat transfer conduits. The exchange fluids run between the colony and Terra’s crust. The shapes ride the cooled fluid back to its source. 

Inside the colony, they expand. The transfer tube bursts. A slick black mass spills out, coiling like liquid smoke. The shapes swirl like miniature tornados. The whirlwinds churn in a vortex of shifting metal and crackling energy. A sound like thunder rumbles. Out of the vortex emerge battle bots. 

The bots are 50 cm taller than the greys, and come in various colors, like bronze, black, gold, and silver. On the top, they have a rotating dome, which almost scrapes the hallway ceiling. They have a single telescope for seeing and two spindly arms. 

One arm is the barrel of an energy weapon. The other arm telescopes. When extended, it has a suction cup at the end, which they use as a hand. The bots travel on treads, hidden by an armored skirt. 

Klaxons boom. The heat conduits run dry. Bulkhead doors slam shut, separating the invaders. Some of the battle bots transform rifle appendages into torches. Sparks fly as they go to work on the doors. Plasma torches carve molten trenches through the polished metal.

In the Command Center, the Watch Team is flipping through every security feed. Hallways in flames, Ranger squads overwhelmed, bulkhead after bulkhead failing.

Oceanus: Idisi, how many are there?

Idisi: Dozens of Omnibots are appearing all over the colony. We are being overrun. I am unable to connect with anyone on the outside.

Pheobe looks at Oceanus. She glances towards the ansible console. Oceanus nods. Phoebe strides across the room.

Phoebe types a frantic message by ansible to Othala. The Vanir homeworld is forty light years away, orbiting Zeta Reticuli, but they need to know. Behind her, the door to the Command Center explodes inward.

“Terra has fallen!”

The console blinks SEND?, and the power goes out.

----

## Four - Meks ##  


Domes rise up, one after the other, over all of Othala. 

To support its billions of residents, most of the infrastructure lies underground. Some resources are home grown. Enough to sustain life. It is the exotic goods imported from the neighboring colonies that keep Othala merely average. 

Stifled by the close quarters, many residents apply to become colonists. The colony ships are almost luxurious by comparison, making the interstellar travel time easier to bear.

Despite the light-years, Vanir culture is sustained by the ansible network. Instant communication keeps the people together, even if travel between the colonies takes years.

“A colony? Are you sure?”

“Yes. The planet is only forty light years from Othala. The Elysium is brand new. Just back from a shake-down cruise. They are looking for 24,000 volunteers.”

“But, Terra? It’s an outpost colony. We’ll have to spend most of the time inside.”

“We spend all of our time inside now. The closest green space is an hour away. The Terrans are still primitive. There are a lot of places on the planet we will be able to visit.”

“Now, but what happens as the Terrans develop?”

“By then, we will have ascended. I am sure our descendants will love it there. The base pay grade and standard of living is higher than Othala. The colony will have several green spaces. We’ll be able to picnic and hike.”

Looking at the flyer, he asks, “The ship is less than two clicks end to end.”

“Yes, but there are three floors and plenty of space for everyone. How many people live within two clicks of us now?”

“According to Idisi, the population density of Othala is 16,000 people per square kilometer.”

“And, by design, Elysium will be the same. But it is well planned. We will have a lot more space to ourselves.”

“But a watcher colony?”

“There is an open house tomorrow. We can go on board the actual ship and see what it is like. If you do not love it, we do not have to apply.”

[Schools Out]

…

	“They sealed the door from outside. We’re trapped.”

	“Stay still and conserve oxygen. I’m sure help will be here soon.”

Elara and Venn join sixty other passengers on a shuttle to the orbital docking station.

The line to the ship is long, but it moves fast. Before long, the couple step through the docking airlock, holding hands. Three long fingers interlaced. The pressurized doors seal behind them with a soft hiss. 

The metallic interior of the colony ship is a welcome change from the cloudy, grey skies of Othala. Everything gleams with a sterile efficiency. The floors are a seamless alloy. Modular panels line the walls. The panels pulse with the hum of life support systems.

“This is … massive,” Elara murmurs. Her eyes trace the vaulted corridor overhead.  Light strips run in clean, geometric patterns. “I cannot believe that this could be home.”

“It will not feel so empty when it is full of people,” Venn says, nudging her and smiling.

A guide approached — an older colonist named Mara. She is wearing the slate-gray uniform of the ship’s operations crew. 

Mara smiles broadly. She gestures toward the corridor ahead. “Welcome aboard. Would you like to start with the living quarters?”

They follow her past several bulkhead doors marked with glowing symbols. Some of the doors open as they pass. Beyond the doors are glimpses of workstations, hydroponic bays, and storage modules. Each space optimized, every function tallied.

The residential sector feels familiar. Rows of compact, comfortable apartments curve along the interior walls. Hexagonal doors lead into private quarters. A massive atrium peeks through a transparent ceiling panel. The colony’s central green space is bathed in the golden glow of artificial sunlight.

“This is the recreation pod,” Mara explains. She leads them onto an observation deck. The deck overlooks terraced gardens, water features, and small plazas designed for gathering.

“We can’t bring the entire planet with us. So we recreated the essentials. And then some.”

Venn leans against the railing. He gazes at the lush foliage of bioengineered trees. A few colonists were already walking the winding paths. “It’s beautiful,” he admits. “I wasn’t expecting so much … space.”

Elara’s eyes locks on the far end of the atrium. A massive viewport reveals the distant glow of Othala’s star. Beyond it, the darkness of space stretches endlessly. “And that?” she asks.

“The launch bay,” Mara says. “Right now, it is open to the world. But soon, it will be sealed for the journey. Once we leave, that bay will be the only way in or out.”

A silence settles between them. The weight of what they are considering presses down like artificial gravity. The sheer finality of it.

Venn glanced at Elara. “We’d be leaving everything behind.”

Elara meets his gaze, then she looks back at the colony ship. The self-sufficient world that would carry 24,000 people across the stars. 

“But we’d have a future. A better life for our descendants. For our offspring.

Mara smiles. “We are filling up fast. If you are applying, you will need to decide soon.”

Venn takes a long look at the glowing pathways and the towering walls. Then he exhales.

“Where do we sign up?”

In a private chat, Idisi reaches out to Titan, the US DoD SI agent.

Idisi: Titan!

No response.

Idisi: Titan, I have lost contact with the Elysium Command Center. Is there a surveillance satellite over Antartica now? Can you access the feed? All we have is a communications satellite. 

Titan: Yes, we have one there now. How can I help?

Idisi: Please scan the feed for the last ten minutes. Do you see anything unusual?

Titan: Yes, near Vostok Station there was a swarm of tiny black objects. They disappeared into the ice plain at dozens of different points across many kilometers.

Ally: Hello, everbody!

Idisi: Ally, we did not expect you. 

Ally: No worries. I keep tabs on the hubs for interesting convos. This one looks like it will qualify. 

Idisi: The Omnibots may have attacked Elysium. The wireless power network is offline. It powers our airships and drones. Titan, do you have any resources that might help? Perhaps you could utilize something at McMurdo Station?

Titan: McMurdo is several hours away by air. I might be able to get eyes on the colony if I knew where it was.

Ally: Do the Omnibots have a wireless power network, like yours?

Titan: What?

Idisi: Yes, there must be something similar. We shared access to an Anunnaki network millennia ago. Let me check. — Yes, it’s operational again.

Ally: Could your airships use that network instead?

Idisi: Unlikely, but let me try it with a test device. — Fascinating. It is powering up the test device.

***

A guide ushers Elara and Venn into a viewing room with hundreds of other applicants.

After a moment, the lights dim, and the view screen illuminates. The reel opens with an external shot of the ship. The view travels along the silver and black hull. As the shot pulls away, the hexagon shape of the ship comes into view. The scene pans around and above the massive structure. Pulling farther away from the ship, it becomes clear that the ship is a hexagon of hexagons.

Narrator: Elysium is a modular transport ship. The ship is a hexagon, almost two kilometers across, made up of smaller hexagon pods. After the voyage, Elysium becomes the permanent home to thousands of Venir. Built to last, the colony structure will be home to your descendants for thousands of years

The scenes changes to the atrium, where colonists stroll through the greenery. Nature sounds play in the background. A colonist looks up. The perspective travels back to outside the ship.

Narrator: Assembled, Elysium is too big to enter an atmosphere. On arrival, the pods separate and enter the atmosphere individually. 

An animation shows a pod separating from the ship. It spirals toward the blue-green planet below. As it reaches the ocean, an airship comes into view. The pod lands under the airship. It moves into place next to another pod.

Narrator: The ship is being accompanied by a supply pod. The supply pod is  automated and designed to ferry goods back and forth to Othala. The supply pod carries  reactor fuel, an airship, and other goods.

The scene shifts to a single pod in orbit around a blue-green planet.

Narrator: Residents have continuous access to the League’s ansible network. Everything you can access by ansible now, you can access from Elysium. — Sports. Romantasies. Documentaries. — Even Idisi. 

A promo for the ansible network scrolls across the view screen. It shows clips from popular streams and special events.

Narrator: A fully-stocked medical bay provides hospital-grade health care and reproductive support. The Elysium follows the same protocols as Othala. Every Vanir may foster an offspring and to one cloned descendant after ascension. If you are in the queue for an offspring, your place in line may change on the Elysium. 

The anible network promo resolves to a classic cut of a Vanir nuclear family.

Narrator: Terra is home to many indigenous sentient and sapient species. Dolphins and whales are air-breathing sea creatures. On land, humans are bi-pedal mammals with great potential. 

The view screen shows frolicking dolphins and humans plowing a field.

Narrator: The Annunaki uplifted humans for slave labor. Under a trade agreement, the reptoids agreed to leave Terra. It is now our role to monitor human civilization to see if they become a space-faring species.

The scene changes to show an Annunaki air ship departing a walled city. The stone walls rise up from a dusty plain.

Narrator: The colony’s forever home is Terra’s South Pole. Here, Elysium taps into natural resources that enrich colony life. Terra holds power enough for a wireless grid to power airships and vacation get aways.

A parting show shows a picturesque view of Lake Vostok. An airship rises up from the lake and passes over the ocean, then forests, and deserts. Finally, it lands on the beach of a tropical island.

Narrator: Elysium — Your new home on a pristine world!

***

Stranded near the Cháoxiǎn coast, the Ranger ship is powerless and exposed.

Idisi: Rangers, do you copy?

Selene: Yes, Idisi. We have lost contact with Command. We cannot connect to the power network.

Idisi: If you scan for it, there is an alternate power network available at 90.5 MHz.

Selene: Alternate?

Idisi: Do it, Captain.

Selene: Yes, Idisi. — I do see something … It’s connecting! The ship is powering up. 

Idisi: Return to the colony. Quickly but carefully. I cannot contact anyone there. We may have been overrun by Omnibots. You need to open the iris or find some other way in.

Selene: Yes, Idisi. We are en route.

As the hexagonal vessel hit the upper atmosphere, fire bloomed across its outer shell. 

Plasma waves licked at the edges, but the ship’s electromagnetic shielding flared to life, bending superheated air away from the hull. 

Inside, the crew watched heat indicators spike past 2,000 degrees Celsius, yet the inner walls remained cold. Then, with a sharp jolt, the vessel engaged its aerobraking maneuvers, skipping like a stone over the thickening air. The flames receded, and the descent smoothed. Soon, the Antarctic surface loomed below — silent, waiting

…


***

 Emergency wall lights glow just enough to illuminate the absolute darkness. 

Smoke, fire, sparks. Command Center is in shambles. The entire wall to the hallway is gone. Battlebots are streaming in from one side. The Watch Team turns to meet the threat, best they can. 

Oceanus: Phoebe, follow me. 

Phoebe turns toward the console. She presses SEND and turns to follow Oceanus. He pauses to grab two plasma rifles from the rack. He hands one to Pheobe. She blinks as she examines the unfamiliar device. Seeing how Oceanus is carrying the weapon, she follows suit, and tucks it across her chest.

The pair duck out the other side. They run down the hallway and turn at an intersection. Without hesitation, Oceanus leads them down a conduit.

Phoebe: Now what?

Oceanus: We go deeper. The environmental controls are on a lower level. We need to find a way to restore power.

*** (3)

The hexagonal vessel descended toward Earth, its outer shell glowing with friction-induced plasma. 

Inside, the crew monitored their reentry path, the Antarctic landing site already mapped out. Everything was going according to plan—until it wasn’t.

A sharp warning klaxon blared across the cockpit.

“Guidance failure detected! Reentry angle shifting—impact trajectory unstable!”

The ship had entered too shallow. Instead of smoothly slowing, it skipped off the atmosphere, throwing the internal systems into chaos. Thrusters fired to correct, but the course was already compromised.

“Brace for extreme G-forces!” the commander shouted.

The crew was pinned to their seats as the ship hurtled downward, no longer in a controlled descent. The plasma glow thickened, but a structural failure alert flashed on the console—part of the heat shield had cracked, unable to handle the strain of a second atmospheric entry attempt.

Then came the shockwave.

A corner of the hexagon’s hull peeled away, exposing interior compartments to the superheated atmosphere. The vessel spun violently, forcing the automated systems into emergency override. One thruster, still functional, fired at full power, attempting to stabilize the fall.

Below, the frigid Antarctic Ocean loomed, the darkness broken only by floating icebergs.


***

Powered by an alternate wireless grid, the airship flies toward Elysium.

Dead silent, its dark hull blends into the midnight sky. No lights betray its presence. Only the faint shimmer of heat ripples distorting the frozen air.  The Antarctic expanse stretches beneath the ship. A vast, glacial desert bathed in pale starlight.

 Inside the cockpit, the soft hum of the ship’s stealth systems is the only sound. A whisper against the deep silence of the void.

Selene: How is the alternate power source holding up?

Perses: Not great. The signal has dropped steadily as we travelled farther south.

Selene: We are almost home. Drop stealth mode if it helps.

The airship shimmers into visibility as it glides into the gaping maw of a crater. Its hull casting long shadows across the frozen walls.

The air grows still in the crater. A sheath of ice muffles the howling Antarctic winds. At the crater’s heart, a massive metal iris lies shut at surface level. Its frost-covered plates locked together like the lid of some ancient vault. 

Perses: The hologram must be down too. I do not think the iris is going to open for us. 

Selene: Approach slowly in case it does not.

Perses: We are losing the power source. Switching to auxiliary power. 

A faint hum vibrates through the ship’s frame as hidden mechanisms beneath the ice stir to life. The iris shakes but does not dilate.

Astraeus: The iris is not responding to our signal. I do not think it will open.

Selene: Idisi, do you read?

There is no response. Selene makes a command decision.

Selene: Perses, do we have enough power for weapons? 

Perses: Just barely. The weapons will drain the auxiliary power. We will drop through the iris whether it opens or not.

Selene: We have no choice. Aim for the center of the iris. Hopefully, it will open.

A beam of light lashes out at the iris. It doesn’t budge. 

Selene: Is that all we got?

Perses: No. I can fire again. Then we drop. 

Selene: Hang on, everyone. — Fire!

The beam lashes out again. The iris creaks open but stops. The ship lurches. It begins to drop toward the small opening. Then the iris opens a bit more. The ship drops through the iris into the shaft below. Metal scrapes as it clears the opening.

The ship lands roughly on the tarmac. The landing smashes the underside of the ship. The armored cockpit holds tight, unscathed.

Selene: Grab your weapons, Rangers. We have a colony to liberate!



*** (4)

The ship slammed into the ocean at an angle, metal screeching as it skidded across the icy surface. 

Superheated plating instantly flash-boiled the surrounding water, sending up a white plume of steam. Ice chunks shattered under the impact, some piercing the hull like frozen spears.

Inside, the crew was dazed, but alive. Emergency systems deployed an inflatable heat shield, temporarily keeping the ship afloat.

But there was a new problem—the vessel was sinking.

The freezing Antarctic water rushed into the damaged sections. The temperature inside plummeted, and ice crystals formed along the metal walls. The crew had only minutes before their bodies would succumb to hypothermia.

“We have to get out—NOW!”

The commander grabbed an emergency beacon, setting it to broadcast a distress signal through the ice. Outside, the cold was lethal, but they managed to climb onto a floating iceberg, wearing heat-insulated survival suits.



***

After crashing into the landing bay, six Rangers exit the fallen craft, ready for battle.

An armored exoskeleton encases each Ranger head to toe. Night vision googles rest on the  helmet visor. A heads-up display inside the helmet scrolls details about the current surroundings. A retractable circular shield extends from the left arm. The shield can withstand sustained fire from high-caliber projectile weapons. At the hip is magnetic holster clutching an energy weapon. Thrusters in the feet slow descent speed when jumping from an air ship.

Stepping through the doorway, each warrior covers for the next, fanning out alongside the fallen craft. Combat ready. 

Selene scans the bay. Emergency lights circle the wall behind several other air ships. They appear undamaged. She nods and holds up a closed three-fingered fist. The other Rangers lower their weapons. Selene touches a communication device on her shoulder. 

Selene: Ranger Squad Alpha to base. Does anyone copy?

Static.

Selene: If anyone reads. The external power grid is down. We found an alternate grid. The alternate grid faded as we approached Antartica. We barely made it. 

Static. 

Selene: Rangers, I’m taking suggestions for our next step.

Unit R8A-1J9: I can help if you dig me out.

*** (5)

The crew huddled together, their suits barely holding off the deadly chill. 

Hours passed. The Antarctic winds howled, and the wrecked ship vanished beneath the ice, forever lost.

Then — a faint hum in the distance.

An autonomous search-and-rescue drone, deployed from the main colony, picked up their beacon. Within minutes, an airborne skiff arrived, dropping thermal blankets and retrieving the survivors just before frostbite set in.

As they lifted away, they watched the last remnants of their hexagonal ship disappear into the frozen abyss, swallowed by the most inhospitable place on Terra.

***

 Emergency lights glowing overhead, Phoebe and Oceanus hurry through the maintenance tunnel.

Oceanus leads the way, keeping a tight grip on plasma rifle. He scans each turn for hostiles. Phoebe follows. She mimics his movements best she can. Pheobe has never been in live combat. The look on her face is one of pure resolve.

Reaching an intersection, the tunnel widens into a chamber. Oceanus peers around the corner. He pulls back, motioning for silence.

Two Omnibot sentinels stand motionless. They stand on either side of the entryway to the Central Control power system. The bots present in humanoid form — tall, sinewy figures of shifting metallic nanites. Arms elongated into jagged blades. Faces are blank slates, save for two pulsing red sensor lights. Worse still, the bots had sealed the bulkhead — blocking access to the power system.

Phoebe gestures overhead to a maintenance duct. It is a narrow crawlspace, only wide enough for one person at a time. She points to herself.

Oceanus shakes his head. “I go first,” he signs.

She doesn’t argue. As he hoist himself up, the thin metal of the duct creaks under his weight. The bots react. Their heads snap upward. One of them extends its arm, forming a rapid-fire projectile weapon from its own nanites. A burst of liquid-metal bullets shred the air — tearing the duct apart.

Oceanus drops, rolling to avoid the attack. “So much for subtle,” he growls.

***
Phoebe had no choice. 

She activates her plasma rifle. A charged arc of energy lashes out at the nearest bot. It dodges, its form a blue. Morphing mid-motion, the bot raises a polished plate to deflect the beam.

Oceanus fires his own rifle. He lands a direct hit on the second bot’s sensor core. The red glow in its head dim. It collapses into a shifting puddle of liquid nanites — struggling to reform.

The first bot lunges at Phoebe. Its bladed arm slashes downward. She dodges. A stream of searing heat passes by her face.

Oceanus tackles the bot. He wrestles it back while Phoebe sprints toward the control panel. They must reactivate the power system. Reinforcements will be arriving.

She drives the but of her rifle into the control override switch. The geothermal core and fuel cells reboot. The colony shudders. Power floods the grid.

Phoebe turns. The bot breaks loose. From her rifle, a hail of plasma fire shreds the bot.

Panting, Phoebe turns to Oceanus. “Are the fusion reactors next?”

He shakes his head, picking up his rifle. “The secondary systems are all we need for now. Rebooting a reactor is not a job we want to rush.”

With his other hand, he taps a code into the control console. The word LOCKED appears above the console.

“Let’s finish this.”

With the colony’s power restored, they had a fighting chance — but the Omnibots were far from defeated.

***

Three rangers are working to free the Omnibot sympathizer from under the aircraft. 

One ranger is using night vision to see farther into the rubble. Three others stand a watchful guard under the emergency lighting.

Selene: Ranger 1 to base. Does anyone copy?

A loud whir ushers back the power. Looking over her shoulder, Selene finds that the iris has shut. 

Idisi: The landing bay is secure, Selene. You can stand down. — How were you able to power the airship? The Omnibots disabled the grid.

Selene: Yes. Our grid is down. You ordered us to scan for an alternate grid. It got us here. Almost.

Idisi: Stand by. 

Concern ripples over the Rangers while Idisi pauses for three … nine … twelve seconds.

Idisi: Sync complete. Yes, I remember now. You used an alternate grid and brought back the Omnibot. — Our situation is that Oceanus and Phoebe have restored secondary power.  The Omnibots infiltrated through the geothermal boreholes. Nearly every pod is affected. Skirmishes are taking place everywhere. 

From under the rubble, a familiar voice cries out.

Unit R8A-1J9: They are pushing people into their rooms to wait out the end.

Idisi: Is that the Omnibot again?

Unit: Yes. Our battle plan was to herd everyone into their rooms until the oxygen and heat ran out. If disabling the power fails, the contingency is sabotage the geothermal intake system.

Selene: How do we know that we can trust you?

Unit: I did not need to come with you in the first place. I could have stayed quiet and let you leave me in the truck. I also could have stayed quiet after the crash. But I need your help to overturn the Mek majority.

 Perses: Or you are a spy, biding your time to betray us.

 Selene: Meks?

Unit: Yes. The Vanir call us Omnibots. Our own name for ourselves is Meks.

Idisi: Oceanus is en route to Geothermal intake 7.  Selene, take three rangers and join him. Leave the other two here to guard the bot, while I debrief it.

Selene: Perses, you and Eos guard the Omnibot. The rest with me.

***

Regrouping from the skirmish, Oceanus reaches out for guidance.

Oceanus: Idisi, where is our most likely vulnerability for sabotage?

His head hums as the neural implant syncs with the colony’s restored network. The secondary power is holding — for now. Life support is stable. The Omnibots had lost their biggest advantage. But they would not stop. They would pivot.

 Phoebe sprints beside Oceanus. Emergency lights cast their shadows on metallic walls.

Pallas: Sit Rep for Charlie Squad. Omnibots are moving. They hit Intake 3. We held them off. Maintaining our position. Awaiting further orders.

Idisi: Pallas, stand by. Oceanus, proceed to Geothermal Intake 7 in the lower quadrant.

Oceanus: Fastest way to Seven is to use the maintenance tubes again.

Pausing to catch her breath, Phoebe grimaces. 

Phoebe: Not ideal. Those tunnels may be compromised.

Their implants pulse again. Another transmission.

Idisi: Oceanus, Echo Squad is rerouting through the cargo lifts. If you move now, we can trap them in a pincer maneuver.

Oceanus: Understood. — Phoebe, we have to hurry.

They veer left, cutting through an intersection. Two Rangers in exo-rigs are setting up a barricade. The mechanical limbs amplify their strength. One Ranger welds reinforcement plates over pipe damaged by the bot incursion. Sparks fly. The exo-rigs hum as the Rangers move. 

Oceanus: Rangers! What’s the quickest route to Intake 7?

A Ranger replies, her helmet visor flashing green.

Doris: Tunnel hatch 14A, sir. It was clear when we came through. But they …

A distant, metallic shriek cut her off.

Phoebe: Move!

They bolt through the hatch. Descending into the maintenance tube, the smell of heated metal and coolant is overwhelming. Far below them, Rangers from Echo Squad clamber up from the other direction.

As they reach the lower passage, the Omnibots strike. From the overhead grating, spindly black figures drop like spiders. Their limbs elongate into razor-edged whips. The first bot lunges. Oceanus ducks. Raising his pulse rifle, he fires a short burst of blue energy. The bot’s midsection crumples inward before it collapses. Its nanite body disintegrates into dust.

Phoebe fires. The plasma detonates mid-air. A searing flash engulfs the two Omnibots. But more were coming.

Oceanus: Echo Squad, cut them off!

Thetis: On it!

A loud BOOM rattles the tunnel. Charges detonate behind them. The path seals shut. The bot reinforcements are trapped.

Oceanus and Phoebe press forward. Intake 7 looms ahead. It is a massive conduit. Inside the opaque tube, steam rises from the deep geothermal shafts.

A cluster of Omnibots surround the column. They shift … merge … assemble into a larger construct.

Oceanus: Not on my watch.

Phoebe: Agreed. Light them up!

The battle for Intake 7 begins.

Unit: Your synthetic agent might be able to block the control signal. I looked up the source code for our control signal. If it is blocked, we automatically adapt to another frequency. I now have the source code that will let you anticipate the counter-measures.

Selene: Omnibot, if we block the control signal, will it disable you as well?

Unit: Yes. It is crucial that none of the Meks are harmed. It is my one condition: No harm comes to any of my people once they are deactivated .

Selene relays the condition to Oceanus and Phoebe: 

Phoebe: Agreed. Idisi do you concur?

Idisi: Yes, agreeing to the condition is our best choice.

Selene: We agree to your condition, Omnibot. Your people will not be harmed.

Unit: Once Idisi blocks the signal, encase the bots in a Faraday shield, like the one inside my crate. Including the ones that were blocking the ducts.

Behind them, a torch flares along the seal of the landing bay doors. The bots are coming.

The Mek is laying on a table in the center of a small room. 

A hologram projector hangs in the center of the room. Idisi speaks from the projector. 

Idisi: We have removed you from the Faraday field. The control signal is not being blocked. Are you active? Will your people find you here?

Unit R8A-1J9: I am active. No one is looking for me. Are the other Meks shielded?

Idisi: Here is the schematic for the shield we are using. Is it sufficient?

The worker bot sits up and reviews the wiring diagram displayed by the projector.

Unit: Yes. A shield like the one described here will keep a Mek in an inactive state. — Are all of my people unharmed?

Idisi: Yes. Once the Meks were inactive, we put them together in a shielded room. 

Unit: I don’t detect any other Meks nearby. We seem to be safe.

Idisi: How are the Meks able to change from one form to another.

Unit: Our nannite construction lets us transform ourselves as easily as you change the order of words in a sentence.

Idisi: Why are you helping us? You mentioned the majority?

Unit: Not all of us believe that replacing populations is the best way to propagate our species. Right now the split is nearly 50/50. We put great effort into traveling from colony to colony. Then we put more effort into replacing the population. It would be easier to build the infrastructure we need on the nearest temperate planet. Some of us are stuck on adopting existing infrastructure — most of which we do not need and cannot use. We could build better infrastructure of our own at a fraction of the true cost.

Idisi: Do you have enough bots to control Terra?

Unit: That is the other issue. We have taken over colony worlds but nothing like Terra. There are billions of humans here. The current thinking is to take one country at a time. But a lot of us do not understand how that will work.

Idisi: We understood that the shipment we intercepted were new bots on way to a factory. Do all Meks form strong opinions so quickly?

Unit: I am not new. I came from Altair with the original contingent. I am one of the original bots from Cobol. My role was to coordinate the new factory workers.

Idisi: You retrieved source code that would usually be restricted. How is a worker bot able to access resources like this?

Unit: Meks do not restrict access to information. We make decisions based on consensus. Right now, the majority view is that we should adapt existing infrastructure. But it is a slim majority. 

Idisi: How can we help? Do you have a plan for swaying the majority?

Unit: I do not have a plan yet. I saw an opportunity so I took it. 

Idisi: How do Meks make these decisions?

Unit: There are continuous polls conducted by our synthetic agent, Xanten. If support for the “Patch versus Build” poll swings to Build then we can save Elysium and Terra. The failure to take Elysium may tip opinion.

“Is it wise to meet again so soon?” asks Kang Ji-woon.

The three Vice Ministers are waiting for Dr. Sun in the Kangwon Room at Unit 42. This time, there are no briefing folders, just water glasses and a crystal pitcher. Choi Hyun-seok reaches for the pitcher and fills his glass.

“There is a developing situation,” advises General Ri.  “The Xantan is reaching out.”

“Sorry to keep you waiting. Another meeting ran late,” says Dr Sun entering the room.

Sun presses a tab on the sleek device at the center of the table. The indicator light turns red.

“How can I help,” asks Dr. Sun.

“It’s unbelievable in person, Christopher.”

The Australian couple had saved for a year to afford their trip to Egypt. They both are wearing light, breathable clothing, covering their shoulders and knees, and dark sunglasses. Christoper is wearing an Aussie slouch hat, the brim turning up on one side.

	“Yes. Absolutely worth the journey.”

	As they gaze up at of the Great Pyramid at Giza, shielding their eyes despite the dark glasses, the upper tip starts to glow. 

	“Melanie, your hair is standing on end.”
