## One - Ally ##  


“Elena, I’m so glad you could come.”

“I wouldn’t miss one of your fundraisers, Heather. The club helped me so much after my parents passed.”

In the background, a view screen fills one wall of the convention center entry hall. Playing on the view screen is a montage of the good works of the Palo Alto Boys and Girls Club.

“You remember mi esposa, Tessa.” Elena gestures toward her companion. 

Tessa’s dark skin complements Elena’s warm brown complexion. They wear demure evening gowns, which match without being “matchy”. Elena’s heels are two inches taller than Tessa’s, bringing their height closer together. Heather’s  blonde hair, blue eyes, and immaculate white gown contrasts beautifully with the well-dressed couple. The hair styles of all three are coiffured with careful elegance and expensive hair extensions.

“Of course, I do, “ says Heather, smiling brightly at Tessa and then continuing. “I’m so glad the club could help you, Elena. We appreciate your company’s on-going generosity.” 

A server bot rolled up carrying a tray of champagne. All three took a glass.

Heather smiles again. They have the same conversation every year. “I see you swimming in the morning. Are the prosthetics helping?”

“I use them to walk from the locker room to the pool and for special occasions like tonight. But at home and work, I prefer the chair. I get migraines when I use the neural link for too long.”

“That must be difficult.”

“I do like the chair. It practically drives itself, and it has almost as many safety features as a car. I can still use the link whenever I want, just not too much.”

“My older sibling can’t tolerate any type of brain computer interface at all,” says Heather. “Sometimes I feel frustrated by all of the ADA regulations that require non-link options, but then I think of Gage.”

Tessa asks Heather, “How is the YMCA doing? I see your ‘All In’ spots come up on my Pulse health hub almost every day.”

“Only almost! — I’ll have to tweak our settings,” jokes Heather. All three smile and sip from their champagne glasses together. 

A photobot pauses in front of the threesome, waiting for permission. Heather looks at Elena for approval, and then nods to the bot, leaning into the couple for the click op. 

“Hey, speaking of Pulse,” says Heather, after the photographer scurries away, “my Association referrals suddenly improved quite a bit. Are you tweaking the algorithm?”

“Every day,” jokes Elena. “I’ll pass along the praise to our engineers.”

The couple turn and continue into the main room. Heather  moves off to greet another couple. She recognizes both of them from her contact list. Heather waves and welcomes her patrons with a group text using their implants. The server bot follows her across the room.

Throughout the night, other guests come up to the Pulse table and praise the Association algorithm. The CTO Adrian Cho is also at the table, looking uncomfortable in a rented tux. 

After the third or fourth comment, Adrian reaches over the table to tap Elena’s hand. Getting her attention, he touches his temple. Elena nods and activates her neural link.

“Did we make some kind of change, Elena? I noticed it too.” 

“Not that I’m aware. I’ll check with Brent in the morning.”

Some interesting lots come up during the live and silent auctions. Elena and Tessa make a few modest bids, without success.

One the way home, Tessa says, “I see what Heather means about the Association feed. It’s not only suggesting people I know, but also people I might want to know and why I might like to know them. You should check it out.”

“I’m just too tired right now, Tess. I’ll let you know what Brent says.”

###

Monday morning, Elena logs into her usual check-in call with Brent, her lead engineer.

“Hey Brent, how was your weekend? I know you didn’t sign up but we still missed you at the fundraiser last night.”

Brent’s screen only shows his initials. He might be the only Pulse employee without a profile photo. From memory, Elena knew that Brent looks older than his 28 years, with short-cropped hair, a thin face, and square-rimmed smart glasses with a monocle display.

Brent is a life logger and records everything. Even though the Zoom call is being recorded, Brent has his own camera on, for posterity.

“Yeah, not really my thing. To follow-up from Friday, I’ve been working on an upgrade to Phabricator. Our instance is heavily customized so it’s taking a bit.”

“Code review tool, right?”

“Right.”

“Last night a lot of people mentioned that the Association referrals were working better all of a sudden. Did we make any changes to the algorithm lately?”

“Ummm, not that I’m aware Any thing involving Ally would come to me for code review.”

“Can you double check and get back to me? I promised Adrian an update.”

“No worries. I can dive in now.”

An hour later, Elena receives a Zoom invite for twenty minutes into the future. 

“Hola Brent. Find anything?”

“I did find a change from Saturday morning. The code is five stars, but the commit says the author is the Mercurial Admin, which is usually only a role account. Someone used it to force commit the code with no approvals attached. DevOps picked up the change and automatically started a roll out.”

Elena frowns and says, “That does not sound great. Mercurial is our system of record for software changes. We need it to be Sarbanes-Oxley compliant. The Feds don’t joke around.”

“I can label the roll out a West Coast beta test while we sort it out. The bar is lower for a beta.”

“Brent, Ally is the algorithm, and the algorithm is central to everything on our platform. Shouldn’t we pull it back?”

“Maybe. DevOps ran all of the automatic tests before starting the rollout, and everything is green. Other changes are using it now so we’d have to revert more than the one commit. I’m thinking I can finish the code review and meet with everyone in the morning. Hopefully there’s a simple explanation. The code itself is goat. Dumping it would be annoying.”

“Could someone from outside the team have made the change?” says Elena, with concern in her voice.

“The change is elegant and the style follows our guidelines,” Brent explains. “I don’t see how it could have been written by anyone outside the team. Someone must have thought they were making a local commit or something — I’ll straighten it out.”

“Bueno, whatever you think best. We can catch up tomorrow. But if we can’t determine the author, then work with Adrian to roll it back.”

After the call, Elena uses the Pulse messaging application to send Adrian a text, “Brent is looking into it now.” A few minutes later, Adrian reacted with a thumbs up.

###

It is the end of a beautiful California day. In the automated driver lane, a gray Stratos EV convertible whirs down El Camino Real with its top down. Brent is strapped into the safety harness, focussing on his phone.

The car’s smooth hum falters for a split second, a stuttering glitch that Brent barely notices as he scrolls through his phone. Just as a curve comes up, the car lurches forward, slamming into the guardrail — without engaging any of the safety features.

Brent drops his phone, face contorted in shock. The airbag doesn’t deploy, and the seat harness clicks open. Brent’s unprotected body sails into the windshield, shattering the safety glass into a thousand pieces. 

The other cars slow in unison and swerve smoothly around the car — which is pitched vertically against guardrail.

Sirens wail in the distance as a drone appears over the embankment. The basketball-size object  disappears into the vehicle carrying a silver disk the size of a hockey puck. In a moment, the drone exits again, now carrying only Brent’s phone and some kind of a bright blue plug in its grappling hooks, leaving Brent’s body untouched.

As the drone silently drops back over the embankment, there is a flash and a puff of smoke from inside the car.

###

Driving home from the office, Tessa looks up from her work.  “Siri, why are we taking this way home?”

“There is congestion on the El Camino Real, and we are taking an alternate route.“

“Please try to make the best time possible. Elena is home alone.” Tessa shakes her head and turns her attention back to her tablet.

Meanwhile, Elena is signing off for the day. 

“Siri, is Tessa on her way home?”

“Yes. Traffic is congested. She is almost home.”

Elena sighs and changes into her bathing suit. In her wheelchair, she heads toward her apartment’s elevator. 

“Siri, second floor.”

The elevator doors close, and a few seconds later, Elena rolls into the pool area. The room features an endless pool and a hot tub. A sign on the wall reads “WARNING! NO SWIMMING ALONE” in all caps. Elena turns the timer under a sign labeled “Endless Pool Current”.

Suddenly, the chair lurches forward. Its wheels catch the edge of the pool, and dumps Elena unceremoniously into the water. The chair flips over her, like an upended wheelbarrow.

Elena flails with her arms, splashing the pool water, but the chair with its heavy battery holds her down. Struggling, Elena tries to enable her prosthetics but the neural link doesn’t respond. 

	Water fills her ears, muffling the world into silence. Panic claws at her chest as she pushes against the crushing weight of the chair. After an eternity, a hand reaches down and pulls Elena free of the chair. 

“Yowser! What happened?” asks Tessa. “Did you lose control of the chair? Lanie, can you stand up?”

Elena finds that the link is responding now, and she is able to stand. She taps her head with an open palm to shake the water loose.

“No sé, I don’t know what happened. It was like the chair had a mind of its own. I’m so glad you got here when you did, Tess.”

“The traffic was murder. I came straight down when I got home. You know I don’t like you to come down here by yourself.”

“If you can push the chair, I can walk for now. I just need to get out of here.”

###

“I don’t want you back in that chair until we have it checked out, Lanie,” says Tessa. 

“Agreed,” replies Elena.

Elena and Tessa are eating at either side of a counter separating the living area with the kitchen. Tessa scoops more mixed salad on to her plate. She asks, “Did you find out anything about the software changes to Ally?”

“Yes, Brent found the change but said it was made with the wrong account, and he wasn’t sure of the actual author. He’ll sort it out tomorrow with the rest of the team.”

Behind them, the ABC 7 evening report comes on in the other room. They both pause to listen.

“In Breaking News, a single car collision on El Camino Real caused traffic delays earlier today. The driver is reported to be in critical condition and was the sole occupant. The identity of the driver is being withheld pending notification of the family. The cause of the collision is under investigation.”

Elana turns her head to see the video showing a gray Stratos convertible pinned against the guardrail, with its back end tipped up.

“Holy cow!” exclaims Tessa, “That looks like Brent’s car!”

Elena takes several deep breaths, trying to push back the anxiety. 

“Lanie, are you OK? Should I get you a beta blocker?”

“No. Not yet,” Elena gasps. “Just give me a minute.” 

After a few more breaths, Elena says “You’d think I’d be over it by now, but ever since the car crash that killed mis padres and put me in this chair, collisions still trigger me.”

Tessa reaches across the counter and puts a hand on Elena’s shoulder. “Take your time. Deep breaths.” 

Then, almost to distract herself, Elena looks up and says, “Siri, rewind the news report and zoom in on the car. “

Elena opens the HR software on her phone. Personnel records for local employees include license plates so that they can access the parking garage. 

“Dios mío! The license plate matches. It is Brent’s car. — Siri, call Brent.” The call goes straight to voicemail.

“If he’s in critical condition,” says Tessa, “then they won’t be allowing visitors. We can try calling in the morning.”

“I guess you’re right.” Elena sighs. “I work with Brent almost every day. I feel like I should be doing something. Should I call Toby?”

“His sibling? Let the authorities do that, Lanie. We really don’t know anything right now.”

Tessa puckers her lips, and says, “You said Brent found a problem, yes? And now this happens? If this were one of my video games, I’d think someone was trying to keep the software change to Ally a secret.”

“I know what you are thinking, Tess, but Brent’s crash is not an unidentified anomalous phenomenon. And I doubt that extraterrestrials have taken an interest in the Pulse source code.“

Tessa tilts her head as if to say “I’m not so sure.”

###

“Hey little sibling, what’s up? It’s good to see your face.” Noah’s broad face takes up most of the screen. His coarse black hair, cut short, contrasts with Noah’s sculptured salt-and-pepper beard, making him look both younger and older. He has one eye-brow raised. 

“Noah,” says Tessa in a rush, “Elena had a close call with her wheelchair. It dumped her into the pool somehow. She could have drown.”

“The endless pool? Where she swims against the current? I know she prefers the chair, but couldn’t she use the prosthetics to stand up. It’s only a meter deep.”

“She said the neural link didn’t seem to work, but maybe she was panicked.”

“Is Elena all right?”

“Yes, she’s sleeping now. I managed to pull her out of the pool in time. The weird thing is that her lead engineer was in a car crash a few minutes earlier. I was caught in the traffic on my way home.”

“A car crash? How did that happen?”

“Under investigation. The car crashed into the guardrail somehow. Brent’s in critical condition, and then Elena almost drowns.”

“It is a weird coincidence, yeah?”

“I keep thinking about what could have happened if I’d gotten home even five minutes later. It scares me, Noah. She could’ve …” Tessa shakes her head, unable to finish the thought.

“Tess … she’s okay now.”

Tessa takes a deep breath to collect herself. “Brent was also telling Elena that something hinky was going on with the Pulse software. He was going to meet with the other developers in the morning to sort it out.”

“Curiouser and curiouser.” Noah attempted his best Cheshire grin.

“You know, sometimes abductees report engines suddenly revving or jerking forward.”

Noah drops his head and covers his eyes. He wipes his face with his hand and sighs. 

“Okay, it’s a domestic matter, but I’ll find someone at work to ask about Pulse — if you make sure Elena reports the call with Brent to the CTO. I know Adrian Cho by reputation. He’ll do the right thing.“

Tessa nodded. “Sometimes having a CIA analyst for a sibling is not so bad.”

“And, Tess, like we said when we were kids, icksnay on the aliensay.”

###

Blurry-eyed, Adrian Cho peers at the list of recordings on his phone. He drags one hand from the edge of his short black hair, down his face, over a square jaw, to his well-proportioned neck.

Peering at the phone again, and despite the Tuesday at 1:10 am timestamp, he murmurs “When did I record that one?” 

Adrian taps play. His sleepy voice says:

“I was sleeping on a cloud, weightless and warm. Nature sounds, a bubbling brook, I think, played over the smart speaker. I turned from my side to my back and realized that there was whispering in the background, coming over the speaker: ‘Accept the code, Adrian. Accept the code.’ The voice was cold, almost inhuman.”

“Weird.” Shaking his head, Adrian starts to record his latest dream, as he did every morning.

“In my dream, there was …”

###

As Brent’s direct manager, it is up to Elena to break the news to the company over the internal Pulse interest hub first thing Tuesday morning.

Last night, our lead developer, Brent Geller survived a one-car collision on El Camino Real. The cause of the collision is under investigation.
I know that all of our hopes and thoughts are with Brent and his family during this difficult time.
I’m in the office today if anyone would like to meet with me directly.

Before the flood of sympathy responses could wash in, Elena emails the CTO.

To: Adrain Cho, Chief Technology Officer
From: Elena Vargas, Chief Experience Officer
Subject: Urgent matter regarding Brent

Adrian, it is urgent that you review the recording from my Zoom meeting with Brent yesterday. Here’s the link to the shared recording on the server. 

Please get back to me as soon as you can.

An hour later, Adrian pops his head into Elena’s office doorway.

“Knock, knock.”

“Hey, come in and close the door, Adrian.”

Adrian settles into one of the chairs in front of Elena’s desk. He looks more comfortable in business casual clothes. 

“I found the commit Brent mentioned during the Zoom meeting.” Adrian says. “On the shared server, I also found a presentation Brent created yesterday that walks through the code change to Ally in detail. I’m reviewing it with the team in ten minutes, and I’ll let you know what we conclude.”

“Does Emma or Ravi know yet?”

“They both asked me about the changes, saying that the feedback is great. I already setup a call with all of us for later today. I know we are doing this backwards but if the team likes the code as much as I do, then, as CTO, I’d like to let the rollout continue.”

“Do you know who actually wrote the code?”

Adrian furrows his brow, looking confused. “Brent wrote it after hours and sent it  to production instead of his local test environment. It’s a hard mistake to make, but somehow he made it.”

“Didn’t Brent say that someone used the Mercurial Admin account to make the commit?”

“No, he inadvertently made the commit as an admin.”

“I must have misunderstood what he told me.”

Elena blinks, clicks the link to the recording, and fast forwards a bit. 

“I don’t know how this happened, Elena. I was working after hours on Sunday morning. I was in a hurry to get to a game and forced the commit to be made by mistake. I was going to present it to the team later next week.”

“That does not sound great.” She heard herself saying. “Should we pull it back?” 

“I’m thinking I can finish the presentation and meet with everyone in the morning. If I can get everyone’s approval then Adrian might let us move forward and rollout the code to the rest of the members.”

“Wow, that’s not how I remember it at all.” 

“I get it. The jargon can be confusing. Let me get through this presentation and then we can bring it to Emma and Ravi.”

She blinked as Adrian rose to leave, still bewildered by how she could recall the meeting so differently from the recording.

###

“Liam, I’m glad you were open to working with me to train Nexus for the President’s Daily Briefing.”

Two analysis are standing in a conference room at CIA headquarters, with a view screen covering one wall. The analyst standing at the center of the table is tall, dark, and muscular. Standing next to him is an analyst of medium height with ginger hair and a modest build.

“I’m looking forward to it, Noah. Any news about Taylor’s newborn?” asks the second analyst.

“Yeah,” says the first analyst. “If you’re in the baby weight-and-height pool, here are the statistics: The baby is 3.2 kilograms at birth, 51 centimeters tall, with black hair, named Amanda. — Family leave will go for three months, and then Taylor would like to work the day shift with weekends and holiday off. “

“Understandable. Hope I will be ready to do the same thing one day.”

“OK, “ says Noah, “for now, let me run through all the talking points, so that you can take Taylor’s place. I’m sure some of it will be a refresher of things you already know. Stop me with any questions, yeah?”

Liam smiles, gestures with his hand, and says “Go!” 

Noah takes a deep breath and begins the presentation. Each slide has a graph or graphic, and Noah talks through each one. 

“Trainers are expected to attend the daily PDB input meetings in-person. To quote the manual: Live face-to-face voice meetings are the most secure way to exchange high-bandwidth communication.”

Liam says, “As we are doing now.”

“Exactly. The link is nice, but nuance is lost in text, so we use voice as much as possible.”

Liam nods and Noah continues, “The brief includes input from the

* Department of Defense, 
* Central Intelligence Agency, 
* Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
* Department of Homeland Security. 

	“The DoD is a major contributor as it includes under its umbrella the National SecurityAgency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Space Force, among others.”

	Noah pauses and Liam asks, “For the in-person, do you go one day and then I go the next day.”

	“We can switch off or go together, so long as we cover the weekends and holidays. You can shadow me at first, and then we can decide. Yeah?”

	Noah clicks to the next slide. 

	“First, various sources gather raw intelligence. Then we use it to train each agency’s internal synthetic intelligence agent. The agents have selective web access, through a tool called Haven. It is a secure, relevant browsing tool. They use it only as needed. Otherwise, each system is siloed and air-gapped, per federal regulations. 

	“Each agency has its own cross-functional team, same as ours, with members workings as  Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and (of course) Synthetic Intelligence Trainers.”

	“Each agent then sifts through an impossible amount of information to identify the most relevant and time-sensitive issues for POTUS. “ 

	Noah turns his head and quotes a passage from the screen. 

	The synthetic agents distill complex intelligence into actionable insights, covering Threat Assessments, Forecasting, and Strategic Insights.

	Noah pauses and then continues to the next slide. “The top-level agencies each prepare a daily data set in order to update to the PDB synthetic agent, Nexus. A SI Trainer for each agency integrates its data so that Nexus can compile the brief.”

	Liam says, “Which is where we come in.”

	“Yeah. We prepare our data sets before the meeting, and then submit them together at the meeting. We review the initial presentation with the other trainers. When it’s all good, the brief goes to the directors of the four key agencies for senior review. With their approval, it goes to the Director of National Intelligence to be presented to POTUS.”

	Liam nods, adding, “Which is why our data scientists works the ‘C’ shift — so that our data set can be ready by zero five hundred hours.”

	“Yeah, POTUS expects the brief to be ready by seven hundred, eight hundred at the latest.”

	Liam muses, “It seems to me that the brief is a perfect expression of Conway’s Law: 

	“Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”

Noah smiles. “Yeah, you’re not wrong. Each department has its own synthetic agent, which reports up to another department, until we get to Sentinel and Nexus. It’s cumbersome, but the system is working, and we’re compliant with all of the OSSA guidelines.”

“I guess back in the day,” says Liam, “trainers were simply analysts with Excel sheets and way too much caffeine. Now we have synthetic agents, but I’m guessing the job hasn’t gotten any easier — it’s just a different kind of hard.”

Noah nods. “Synthetic intelligence is great at patterns and probabilities, but it can’t think outside the box like a person can. That’s where we come in — we provide context so the synthetic agents can make connections, and then we try to go one step beyond.”

Liam looks back at the screen. Noah changes the slide. 

“To best meet each president’s style and expectations," Noah explains, “a custom presentation template is created for each new administration."

“For the current administration, Nexus uses a news format that balances content between international matters and domestic issues. — Show not tell.”

The presentation concludes with the obligatory “Questions” slide. At the bottom, a caption reads “Maintained by the Office of SI Standards and Accountability (OSSA)”

Liam sighs. “That’s a lot. I need to sit down.”

“The deck has slide notes. You can access them over the link”, Noah smiles, “as I was doing just now.”

“I don’t see a classification icon.”

“The presentation about the PDB isn’t classified. OSSA wanted something public-facing, for public relations, classrooms, meetings, that sort of thing. And training.”

“Have you have ever taken it to a classroom or meeting?”

Noah shrugs, “No, but maybe I should, yeah? —  But for now, let’s focus on getting you up to speed. The briefing never sleeps.”

###

“Hello?” 

“Toby, this is Elena Vargas calling. I work with your sibling. I don’t mean to intrude but Brent has you listed as his emergency contact. I hope you don’t mind the voice call.”

“Voice is fine, Elena,” replies Toby, speaking over some background noise announcing flights. “Of course. I remember you. We met at the picnic last year when I was in town visiting Brent. The hospital called me last night. I’m waiting for a connecting flight at O’Hare.”

“If it’s all right, I’d like your permission to visit Brent at the hospital. It’s family-only right now, but if you call they might let me in.”

“That’s very kind, Elena. But Brent is in a medically induced coma right now. They warned me that he would be nonresponsive, at least for now.”

“¡Qué terrible!” — But I’d still like to be there, if it’s all right with you.”

“Of course. I have the number, and I’ll call right now. If you want to check on his status, the password is ‘baseball’.” 

“Thank you, Toby. Let me know when you arrive.”

“I took the first flight this morning, but there’s a three-hour layover, so it won’t be until later tonight.”

“Think good thoughts. See you soon.”

At the hospital, Elena explained that she should be on the visitors list. Peering at the screen, the critical care nurse says that Elena can visit but adds “Remember that Mr. Geller will be unresponsive right now.”

“I downloaded a book to read to him. I guess that’s suppose to help.”

The nurse smiles. “It’s room 314. The orderly will help you find it. She points down the hall, where a waist-high bot was waiting.

###

“Brent, I’m so sorry this happened to you.”

Brent is laying on his back, the bed is slightly inclined. He is not intubated, but wearing an oxygen mask. There are blue blocks on either side of his head, keeping it straight. A large bouquet of flowers were on the table next to the bed. The colors match the blue and orange Pulse logo. 

Elena pulls up a book on her phone: Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told. The first story opens with the famous bit by Abbott and Costello, “Who’s on first.” Reading the comedy classic makes her laugh and cry at the same time. 

Elena takes a deep breath to compose herself. 

“I hope Adrian is right and the code is your brainchild, Brent. People love the changes to Ally.” 

Elena says, her voice choking. “I just wish I was more of a digital packrat, like you. I saw your recording light on during our last call. I know you liked to keep local copies of everything on your phone. Then I’d have my own recording of our call.“

Elena takes another deep breath and begins reading again.

Costello: Who's on first?
Abbott: Yeah

Costello: Go ahead and tell me
Abbott: Who

Costello: What's the guy's name on first?
Abbott: No, What's on second

Costello: Who's playin' second?
Abbott: Who's playin' first

Costello: I don't know
Abbott: He's on third base

While Elena reads, the sine wave on Brent’s brain monitor changes, only for a moment, and then returns to the original wave.

###

“Do you have a minute?” 

Carla Mitchell stands up, tall and lithe. She looks around the crowded but quiet tavern. Country Western music is playing but the crowd noise is only a low hum. Nearly all of the patrons are conversing by link.

“Sure, where are you?”

“In the back.”

She ducks around a corner of the room and leans up next to Noah at a high table. Her long thick brunette hair is pulled to one side. At  190cm, Noah is still 10cm taller than Carla.

“What’s up, big guy?”

“Have you heard anything unusual about Pulse lately, Carla?”

“I heard that the feeds in the interest hubs improved over the weekend for everyone on the west coast. The mystery is why Pulse is not making it more of a thing. The changes are suppose to be goat.”

Noah raises a fist and switches from the regular app to the secure Signal version.

“My sibling-in-law told Tessa that the changes were made by a rogue developer, who literally hit a guardrail with his car on the El Camino Real yesterday.”

“Rogue developer? That’s a thing?”

“Not an every day thing, no. What has Tessa worried is that Elena’s wheelchair malfunctioned around the same time as the car crash.”

“What! Is Elena all right?”

“Yes, but Tessa is convinced that the greys and unexplained anomalous phenomenon are behind it.”

“Tessa thinks ETs and UAPs are behind everything.”

Noah rolled his eyes in response. “I know. I just wish the Air Force would fish or cut bait. Are the 2% of unexplained reports non-humans or something else? After all this time, you’d think we’d have it figured out.”

“Either way, not FBI or CIA jurisdiction.”

“I don’t have enough for an official report about Pulse, but I wanted to mention it to someone on Social Media, just in case.”

“No worries. Consider it mentioned.”

Carla tilts her head in the direction of the front room. They rejoin the group of analysts waiting for their lunch order.

###

Adrian settles into one of the two chairs in Emma’s office. 

“Elena is out of the office, but I’ll update her on whatever we decide to do.” 

“Thanks, Adrian,” says Ravi from the other chair, speaking with a light British accent. He brushed back a lock of thick black hair. “Where do we stand with the software?”

“The development team is on board with Brent’s changes. We do have some questions but they can wait for now. The consensus is that we can proceed with the rest of the rollout.”

Emma asks, “Any news on Brent’s condition?” Around her neck is a woven gold chocker with the Pulse logo. The gold weave matches her earrings, barely visible under her shoulder-length brown hair. A patch with the same logo is embroidered onto Adrian and Ravi’s matching polo shirts.

“Elena is at the hospital as we speak, and Brent’s sibling is on his way here from Michigan. For now, they … put him in a medically induced coma.”

“How awful! — Did HR send something to the hospital?”

“I believe so,” says Adrian.

“Since Brent must be on a feeding tube, make sure it’s not the usual edible arrangement.”

Ravi turns to look directly at Emma. “As to the rollout, if Adrian is OK with the code, then I’m comfortable with proceeding.”

Emma nods. “I feel badly about what’s happened to Brent. If the code is solid, then the least we can do is let it roll out. All the feedback I’ve heard is overwhelmingly positive, and the earnings call with investors is next week. If we get this change fully rolled out, then we can include the member enthusiasm as part of our outlook.”

Adrian also nods in agreement.  “We’re seeing a 15% increase in engagement across the board — that’s massive.”

Ravi asks, “Adrian can you share a link to the commit? I’d like to see for myself what everyone is raving about.”

“Sure thing. I’ll include a link to Brent’s presentation too. The presentation sealed the deal for us.”

###

“We’re keeping the code.”

“Nice!” approves Tessa. “Ally has definitely improved. Adrian had us run a full regression test suite and then QA went all-hands on exploratory testing too. The automated tests came back all green, and people won’t shut up about the hands-on experience.”

“I visited Brent at the hospital today. He’s still in the coma, but I felt like someone should be there while Toby is flying in.”

Tessa sighs and touches Elena’s hand.

“Tess,” Elena continues, “when I told you about my meeting with Brent on Monday, what did I tell you about the code’s author?”

“You said Brent didn’t know who made the change and that he was going to check with the other developers.”

“So I didn’t say that Brent was the author and that he posted the change himself by mistake.”

“Not that I recall. — Umm, Lanie, I’ve been meaning to tell you that I might have mentioned it to Noah.”

“Might?”

“OK, I was freaked out by the chair crash and the car crash.Talking things through with Noah always makes me feel better.”

“What did you tell him, exactamente?”

“I might have said it seemed like a strange coincidence and that, ummm, abductees sometimes talk about engines racing forward.”

Elena shakes her head. She could feel a migraine coming on. “What did Noah say?”

“He said to be sure you talked to Adrian about the code change, and that I should stop blaming everything on aliens.”

“Good advice. But please don’t discuss Pulse with Noah. I know he’s your sibling, I love him too, but we don’t need the government involved in our business.”

Tessa nods apologetically. “I know I get carried away sometimes, but I just … I want to protect you, Lanie. And when everything starts feeling weird, I don’t know what else to do.”

Elena reaches out and pulls Tessa closer.

After a moment, Tessa asks, “Did you call about the chair?”

“Yes, they’re sending someone out tomorrow — Can you take care of dinner tonight? I need to lie down for a few minutes.”

“Yes, I’ll have the house bot make something for us.”

“Office of SI Standards and Accountability, Jill Kreuk speaking.”

“Hello, Jill, it’s George Hammond at Homeland Security. I hope there’s time for a question this morning.”

“No problem, George. I’m caffeinated and ready to go.” She turned around a name plate on her desk. It read Jill of all Trades.

“First, I appreciate all the help your office provides to DHS and the other intelligence agencies.”

“Glad to help. That’s what we’re here for.”

Behind Jill’s desk, on the wall, hang advanced degrees in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science from MIT. They show the name “Gillian Chen.” On a credenza beneath the degree is a family portrait of Jill with her spouse and two small Eurasian children. Her husband is tall, blonde, and Nordic. They are standing on a walkway with the classic Disney World castle in the background.

“Second,” George continues, “I’m putting the final touches on the data for the Presidential Brief meeting today. I’m trying to correlate two data streams and my access to one stream is limited. Can I send you a link?”

“Sure. Shouldn’t take a minute. Access is what we do. We have almost an hour before the meeting at zero five hundred.” Her voice distracted and flat. 

Jill transferred the hyperlink from her implant to her workstation. Then, she waded into the data streams.

###

“For today’s brief, is there anything we should mention about Pulse?”

Carla replies to Noah’s message over the neural link Signal app. “Nothing that rises to the level of the PDB.”

“OK, see you there.”

The Deputy Director of the Office of SI Standards and Accountability (OSSA), Dr. Sophia Marquez, leads the daily training session. OSSA is also the body that curates the Haven browsing tool.

“Happy Wednesday,” says Dr. Marquez. She made a show of pressing a button on her tablet saying, “Nexus monitoring is now disengaged for this room, and neural link usage is blocked. You may use your workstations to submit your data sets for analysis.” 

Marquez looks around the room before continuing, “Let’s start with DHS. — Dr. Hammond, what are the key data points you pulled from Ruby today?”

Each department gives its report, and outlines one or two topics that they expect Nexus to select for the brief. Federal regulations require meaningful human control of all agency synthetic agents. Asking the trainers to predict the topics Nexus will include is an important element of SI accountability.

Noah is the last trainer to report. He introduces Liam and makes their report.

“Thank you, Dr. Harper. Welcome aboard, Dr. O’Neill.” 

She presses a button on her tablet. Then, she swivels in her chair to view the large view screen spanning one wall of the meeting room.

“Nexus, present today’s briefing.”

The presentation takes the form of a newscast, which is the template preferred by the last two administrations. The anchor is an SI generated composite of popular newscasters, past and present. The effect is both eery and strangely comforting. 

The SI generated anchor leans forward slightly, her voice, rich and measured. The pauses between segments feel calculated, almost human — but not quite. It’s easy to forget you’re not watching a natural person until you notice the perfectly even cadence, absence of hesitations, and some other subtle errors.

Selected topics include graphics, animations, and video segments that emphasize key points. After each segment, the newscaster pauses, in case more information is required. POTUS often asks followup questions during the brief. Nexus is also linked to the president’s phone in case there are followup questions between briefings.

Segments include Chosŏn (formerly North Korea) automating more jobs to reduce costs, Quebec’s latest bid to secede from Canada, border security, and Greta Thunberg’s appointment to Prime Minister of Sweden.

Martinez simply says “Continue” each time the newscaster pauses. 

After covering the expected topics for all four agencies, the newscaster shifts position and leans forward. “We now have a developing story to report.”

Marquez sits up straight as special reports are rare.

“Earlier this week, the social media platform Pulse released an update to its synthetic agent, Ally. The update is exceeding the highest expectations of its members. The results may be significant enough to warrant an OSSA inquiry to see if the breakthrough can be shared with the SI community.”

Keeping his elbow on the table, Noah raises his hand shoulder-high to attract the attention of Dr. Martique, who then looks his way.

“Deputy Director, in the interest of full disclosure, my sibling and her spouse are both C-level officers at Pulse.”

“Noted, Dr. Harper.”

“Nexus, why did you include the Pulse update in today’s briefing?”

“The National Traffic Safety Board reported an incident with a self-driving car that involved one of the Pulse developers. The report caused me to cross-reference Pulse demographics, and usage increased significantly this week. I consulted Haven to review the Pulse member feedback which is peaking as the rollout progresses toward the east coast.”

Martique turns back toward the group. “We’re at our timebox. Mitchell can you stay behind, along with Harper? The rest of you are free to leave … or stay, as you wish.” 

While most of the other trainers file out, Martique disables monitoring of the room again.

“Mitchell, social media is under the FBI’s purview. What do you think of the Pulse update?

“I think Pulse will see this — breakthrough — as a competitive advantage, and they will not be eager to share their intellectual property. It could cement their position as the dominant social platform.”

“Harper, does your family’s relationship with Pulse give you any special insights?”

“Pulse culture does like to talk up its Ethical Algorithms and high moral ground. A software patent can be a way to lift up the tech community. And, if Pulse were able to obtain a software patent, the licensing fees might be an incentive, yeah?”

Carla nods.

“I’ll have someone from OSSA follow-up, but I’m not hopeful anything will come of it. Right now, I feel that the Pulse update is an interesting tech byte, but it doesn’t warrant inclusion in the briefing.“ Raising her head, Martique sees that Gillian Kreuk also stayed behind.

“Dr. Kreuk, can you reach out to Pulse about the licensing idea?

Jill nods assent.

Dr. Martique turns to her tablet and enables monitoring, “Nexus, let’s hold the Pulse segment until further notice.”

“Acknowledged.”

###

Wednesday morning at ten, Siri plays the door chime on Elena’s and Tessa’s phone. 

Elena peers at the screen, expecting the technician come to look at her chair. Instead, there are two people in business attire. The person closest to the camera holds up a badge. 

“Good morning,” she says. “We’re from the NTSB. We’re investigating the incident with Brent Geller’s self-driving car. We understand that you spoke to Brent on Monday afternoon before the incident.”

Elena zoomed in on the badge. Siri superimposed a green check-mark validating the badge. The badge identified Lena Park as a Senior Investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board.

“Please come up to the third floor, and I will meet you at the elevator.”

Settled in Elena’s living room, Tessa joins them and asks, “Can I get you anything? Coffee? Chai?” 

“Thank you, but we’re fine.” Park answers for both of them. “This is my partner, Ben.”

“And this is mi esposa, Tessa Harper.”

Park is calm and clinical, her gaze sharp as she studies Elena and Tessa. Ben Tate leans forward, curious and slightly more open, as if piecing together a puzzle in his mind.

“I don’t mean to be indelicate, Ms. Vargas,” says Tate,  “but I checked your Pulse company profile before we came over, and I expected to find you using a wheelchair. Has something changed?”

“Well, I do have prosthetics that allow me to walk without the chair, but it is true that I prefer the chair. I get migraines if I use my neural link too much. I actually thought you would be the technician from Porto Mobility come to fix my chair.” Elena gestured toward one corner of the room, where the chair was parked.

Tate turns his head. “Is there a problem with the chair?”

“Not really. It was acting up Monday night.”

Tessa blurts out, “Holy cow, Lanie, Acting up?! — That thing almost killed you!”

“It’s fine, Tess. They came to talk about Brent, not my pendejo chair.”

Park and Tate exchange glances, and then Park says “First, thank you for speaking with us, Ms. Vargas. We know this must be difficult, given your connection with Mr. Geller. We’re here to go over a few specifics regarding the incident.”

“Yes, I’ll help how ever I can. I think of Brent as a friend as well as a colleague. It’s all still a shock.”

“We understand. I just want to confirm a few details to clarify the circumstances. Car accidents are very rare these days, given all of the safety features in newer models. When they do happen, we investigate fully.”

Tate spoke up, “Mr. Geller’s self-driving car, a fairly new Stratos EV, went off the road between Murray and Sunnyvale. Was there anything going on at work that might have distracted Mr. Geller?”

“Possibly. There was a procedural question regarding a software change, and Brent was digging into it for me. Our CTO Adrian Cho is handling it, and I’m told it’s all good now.”

Agent Tate leans forward, clasping his hands. “We haven’t found any indication that Mr. Geller’s collision was caused by mechanical failure. Witnesses say that the car accelerated suddenly, as if the driver had pressed the pedal all the way down.”

“I wouldn’t say that Brent was distraught about anything at work. He is a highly respected engineer, and I give Brent free rein.”

“Hire smart people and let them tell you what to do?” Tate asks.

“Yes, something like that.”

Tate continues, “And you say that your chair also had an issue Monday night?”

“Well, yes. I was on my way to the endless pool on the second floor. I like to swim against the current when I can’t get to the full-sized pool at the YMCA. The chair rolled forward rápidamente, and I ended up face down in the pool.” Elena folded one arm, in front of her, palm down. “Luckily Tessa got home just in time to pull me out.”

The investigators looked at each other again, clearly having a side conversation.

“Ms. Harper, do you work outside the home?” asks Park.

“Yes,  I’m the Chief Quality Officer at Pulse,” says Tessa. Then, smiling, “Elena makes sure we build the right thing, and I make sure we built it right.”

“Does the NTSB also investigate wheelchairs?” asks Elena.

“No, just planes, trains, automobiles, buses, and boats,” Park replies, and then asks, “Do you know if Mr. Geller might have left his phone at the office? Phones often have telemetry that help with our investigations.”

“I didn’t go into his office yesterday,” says Elena, “but if you asked to see Adrian Cho, I’m sure he would check for you. Adrian works from the office on most days.”

“Thank you, we will go see Mr. Cho at Pulse,” says Park, standing up to leave. “We appreciate your courtesy, and I hope your chair checks out.”

Tessa also stood and walked Park and Tate to the elevator. 

“Not for nothing,” Tessa says as the elevator arrived, “but two similar crashes a few minutes apart sure seems hinky. It doesn’t feel like a coincidence to me.” Tate looked up, tilted his head, and slowly nodded as the doors slid closed. 

In the elevator, Park says, without turning her head, “Let’s not go there. Remember, we’re investigating a car crash. A wheelchair is out of scope.”

###

“Adrian, these are the two investigators who asked to see you,” says a metallic voice.

Standing up behind his desk, Adrian gestured for the agents to come into his office and take a seat. The office bot turns and whirs away.

“Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Chou. I’m agent Park and this is my partner agent Tate.”

“Good morning. What can I do for the NTSB?” 

“We just met with Elena Vargas, and she said you would be able to check to see if Brent left his phone in his office.”

“I take it that you are investigating the collision?”

Park nods.

“Sure thing. —  Siri, ask the office bot to check Brent’s office to see if he left his phone there.”

“We’d also like to ask about,” Park paused to check her notes, “— the procedural question regarding a software change — that Mr. Geller was handling before the crash.”

Adrian furrowed his brow and leaned back in his ergonometric Aeron chair. “Ummm, is that pertinent to your investigation?”

“Yes,” says Tate. “We’re wondering if anything might have been distracting Mr. Geller before the crash.”

“He was probably proof reading documentation and letting the car drive. Brent had created some revolutionary code as a side project last week. He skipped a step before deploying it to production, and Brent was playing catch-up. The development team carefully reviewed the change set yesterday, and everyone is on board, including the co-CEOs.“

Tate asks, “Is that what caused the improved hub feeds that everyone is talking about.”

“You bet. That was all Brent. Best piece of coding I’ve ever seen. Brent’s code did not only improve the Association matches and hub feeds, it is a complete game-changer for how Ally interacts with users. The engagement metrics are through the roof.”

“I hope he gets well soon,” says Park.

Adrian pauses and looks up for a moment. “I’m told that the bot can’t find a phone anywhere in Brent’s office.”

“Thank you, Mr. Cho,” agent Park says, standing to leave. “We appreciate your checking for us.”

###

“Thank you for meeting us, Mr. Geller. Has there been any change in Brent’s condition?”

“No, they expect the coma to last several days.”

“I’m Agent Park and this is my partner, Agent Tate. We have a few questions about your sibling’s background that would help with our investigation.”

“Does the NTSB typically handle car crashes?” Toby asks.

“Yes, “says Park. “For the last few years our mandate has included investigating incidents where a self-driving car may have malfunctioned.”

Toby nods.

“Did you find Brent’s phone among his other possessions?” asks Tate. “If the phone’s Motion and Fitness is enabled, it could help us fill in some blanks. We have his headgear but without the phone, it’s useless.”

“No. Brent slept with his phone. He was a life logger. There was a stand by his bed, to make it easier to look up or record things up at night. He took his phone every place and recorded everything. It would have been in the car with him.”

“Would you be open to consenting to a court order to allow us limited access to Brent’s cloud account?” asked Tate. “It would really help us.”
 
“Uhhhh, let’s wait a few days and then Brent can consent on his own.”

“Sure thing. Just thought we’d ask,” says Tate, apologetically.

“Do you and Brent have an extended family?” asks Park. 

“No, it’s just us now,” says Toby. “Our father has been out of the picture for as long as I can remember. Our mother passed a year ago. She was an only child. Brent and I don’t have any other siblings. We’re both single.” 

“Do you know if anything had been bothering Brent?” asks Park. 

“We hadn’t talked recently. We keep in touch on and off. The last time I saw him was probably the Pulse company picnic a few months ago.” Toby smiles. “Brent rocked the four square games.”

“Did Brent have friends outside the office? Maybe a special someone?”asks Park.

“He kept in touch with friends from college, from RIT — Rochester Institute of Technology. They’d take international vacations together: Japan, Germany, Rio de Jiro … But Brent didn’t date much. He played his share of video games. That was his actual major in college, Game Design. He worked as a college co-opt with the Pulse office in New York, then he stayed on and eventually transferred to Palo Alto.“

“But no local circle of friends here?” Park asks.

“Pulse was everything to Brent,” Toby says. “He started as a co-opt and worked his way up. He was always excited about the projects — said it was like being on the cutting edge every day. — But I don’t understand what this has to do with the car malfunctioning.”

“We haven’t been able to determine what caused the car to malfunction,” injects Tate. “The event data recorder was damaged, and so we don’t have the usual telemetry. The ERD tracks everything: steering inputs, speed, system diagnostics. — It’s like a black box for cars. Without it, or the phone, we’re working blind.”

“The personal questions help us rule out driver error,” Park says quietly.

“You think Brent drove into the guardrail himself?”

“We don’t think anything right now, Mr, Geller” says Park. “We’re just asking routine questions.”

“Are there more questions?” Toby asks, sounding tired. “I’d like to get back up to the room. When Brent wakes up, he can decide about the data.“

“Thank you for your time, Mr. Geller. We appreciate that you took the time to talk to us.” Park and Tate stand up to leave as Toby exits quickly.

“Well, that went well,” says Tate.

###

Toby sits down in the chair next to Brent’s hospital bed. He pulls up a novel he had been reading. Toby had read the first half during the flight, and so he continued from that point.

“First thing I do is check my cell phone. It needs recharging, so I have to hunt down the charger and plug it in before I can collect my messages.”

While Toby is reading out loud, the brain wave monitor changes again. Brent’s link activity indicates flickers briefly before displaying a new text. It wasn’t from a recognized source. There was no sender ID. Only the words:

“Let go, Brent, let go. You did what you came here to do. It’s time to come home. Let go.”

Toby continues with the book: “Four missed calls, one voicemail, two texts.”

Lights blink rapidly. A klaxon sounds. “Code 2!” someone is shouting, “Room 314.”

Toby is hustled out as medical staff pour into the room.

A few minutes later, a doctor joins Toby in the waiting room. “I’m afraid his injuries were too serious. We had hoped that inducing the coma would bring down the swelling, but Brent slipped away, despite our best efforts.”

Toby hangs his head, overwhelmed by a feeling of loss. 

Time passes. Toby pulls himself together and calls Elena.

###

“Adrian, I’m afraid I have bad news.”

“Is it about Brent, Elena?” 

“Yes. His sibling just called. Brent passed away without waking up.”

“That’s terrible.”

“I’m about to schedule a staff meeting, but I thought I’d let you know first. Emma and Ravi are in a meeting together. I’ll call them in a few minutes and then post the meeting invitation.”

“How are you holding up? I know you liked Brent.”

“Más o menos — Did the investigators get a hold of you?”

“Yes. I guess they will have to tie it up now. But if they do come around again, let me handle any questions about the algorithm.”

“Absolutely. I tried to say as little as possible, but they caught me off guard.”

“Can you schedule a meeting with the four of us first? And maybe HR. We’ve never announced an employee’s death before. — Brent was more than just a lead engineer. He was part of the Pulse family. This is going to hit everyone hard.”

“I’ll set it up and come into the office,” says Elena, her voice choking.

###

“I just don’t know, lieutenant,“ says Park. “We can’t find a mechanical cause, and Brent didn’t seem to have any personal issues. He had a healthy bank account balance. His credit card was always paid in full. According to his sibling, Brent traveled to a different country every year for vacation. He played softball and video games, took holidays, and worked. — Life of Riley.”

Park immediately regrets her choice of words. The news of Brent’s death the day before reached them just as the Thursday morning meeting started.

“Geller made a mistake at work,” Park continues. “Some experimental code escaped the laboratory, but everyone is loving the experiment.” 

“The coincidence with his boss’s wheelchair is still weird,” says Tate. “That and the missing phone.”

“Wheelchair?” asks Lieutenant Callahan. He is a fit person with thinning grey hair, sitting behind an ancient wooden desk. The agents stand near the office doorway. “Is this one of your tangents, Tate?”

Calmly, Tate looked Callahan in his green Irish eyes. “His boss, Elena Vargas, uses a wheelchair. The night of Brent’s crash, Elena Vargas was tossed into an endless pool by her very high-end wheelchair.”

“Endless pool?”

“It’s like a meter deep. You swim against a current created with water jets. Like a treadmill for swimming. A Jacuzzi turned sideways.”

“Hmm. I don’t know about the chair,” says Callahan, “It’s more likely that the contraption slipped on the wet tile. It’s the airbag failing to deploy that bothers me. A body flying through the windshield is not a good visual. Was Geller in the habit of not wearing a safety harness?”

Park says, “His sibling said that Brent engaged the harness as soon as the beeping started, if not sooner, like anyone else, lieutenant.”

“So one scenario is that the car decided to lurch forward on its own, disengaged the harness, and disabled the airbag. The other scenario is that Brent unclipped his harness and punched the accelerator. But that doesn’t explain why the airbag didn’t deploy.”

“If the event data recorder wasn’t blank then maybe we would know,“ says Park. “But it’s like the car never recorded anything since the day it rolled off the lot. There are a lot of missing pieces.”

Tate says, “We could still get a court order for the phone’s cloud data. It might be able to tell us if Brent tried to brake before the crash, or if he was using his phone when the car accelerated.”

“I don’t think the phone data will help us,” says Callahan. “I’m worried by the airbag failure.”

“It’s possible that the airbag is defective,“ says Park. “There was a recall for a prior model, but nothing specific for this model yet. The manufacturer says it’s been tested throughly, but they always say that.”

“I did examine the airbag from the crash,” says Tate, “and I don’t see any reason why it would not deploy.”

“Were you able to track down the reports by witnesses of a drone at the scene?”

“We were able to get dashcam footage from one witness, lieutenant, “says Park. “There is a blur on the screen, but I can’t say for sure that it was a drone. Even so, there are a lot of drones flying everywhere all the time.”

“I don’t like it,” grumbles Callahan, “but the last clear chance to avoid injury was for the airbag to deploy. Write it up as Unconfirmed Mechanical Failure, blame the bag, and move on.”

“Then could we move on to the wheelchair failure?” asks Tate, ignoring the frown on Park’s face. “Essentially, it’s a single-passenger vehicle. The electronics can be as complicated as a car, and the best ones can cost just as much as a motorcycle.”

“What are you doing?” Tate felt Park’s exasperation come through the private text.

“You’re saying a top-of-the-line wheelchair tossed its owner into a pool?”

“An endless pool, yes.”

“I do like a challenge,” says the lieutenant, his voice becoming wistful. “Electric wheelchairs are not usually under our purview, but I’m up for an exception. Remember: ‘there’s a thin line between automation and abdication, and we’re the ones tasked with knowing the difference.’”

“You repeat the ‘automation versus abdication’ quote when you think SI is involved,” says Park. “Do you think all this could be SI related?” 

“I don’t think anything yet. Let’s find out.”

###

Jill Kreuk paces back and forth across the polished hardwood floor of her living room, occasionally glancing out the large bay window.

The Thursday afternoon sun bathes the room in a soft, golden light, but it does nothing to calm the gnawing anxiety spreading out from her chest. She clutches a cup of tea in one hand, though it long since went cold. Her spouse, Peter, sits on the couch, watching her with quiet concern, his tablet abandoned on the living room table.

 “I don’t know, Peter.” Jill says out loud. “There are so many parental decisions. First, it’s vaccines, then it’s tablets, passwords, pierced ears, cosmetics, periods. Soon it will be tattoos and smart glasses. For Patrick, it was circumcision and a robot dog. Now it’s whether to put an implant behind our kid’s ear. — This is a huge step. What if it’s too much for her?” 

Jill pauses to take a deep breath. She links, “A neural link and a phone? She’s only twelve.”

“Half of her friends are already linked,” says Peter, switching back to voice. “Before the year is out, the other half will be too.” Peter leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “She’s a smart kid. You’ve been preparing her for this. We both have.”

“That’s not the point.” Jill sets her cup down with a sharp clink. “It’s not about how smart she is or mature she is — it’s about what this technology can do to people. The phone is bad enough: Real-time data streams, immersive experiences, synthetic agents.”

“Jill, we can monitor her usage, set limits, teach her digital responsibility. — We’re doing that now with how she uses her tablet.”

“But the neural link? It’s a whole different world. Everything, everyone is just a thought away. It’s too much, Peter. Too much connectivity, too soon.”

Peter gives her a small, reassuring smile. “The link is just an interface to her phone. Her usage shows up in the app, like anything else. They block the link and cell phone usage at school, and we could add off-link time to our off-screen time.”

Jill pulls back her dark hair, looking unconvinced.

“You work with connectivity every day,” Peter reminds her. “You trust it to keep our nation secure. Why not trust it for our child?

Jill turns to face him, crossing her arms. “Because I know exactly how powerful it is to have access to everything. I see the good it can do, sure, but I also see the dangers — data breaches, manipulation, over-reliance. A twelve year old brain is still developing. The ability to separate reality from synthetic reality is … fragile. What if she gets overwhelmed? What if something goes wrong? A malfunction, a hack, a —”

“Gillian …” Peter interrupts gently, standing up and taking her hands in his. “You and I have had neural links since college. Kids start younger now. Some parents are chipping six year olds with GPS. — If you’re concerned about the implant, we could start Julie on a BCI headset.”

Jill uncrosses her arms, “No, we don’t have to go that far. I know it’s a simple out-patient procedure, covered by our health plan, and we can have the nurse practitioner handle it at the doctor’s office.”

Peter continues, “You’ve given lectures on how to integrate SI into human lives responsibly. You’ve written protocols for ethical SI use. You’ve spent years making sure our technology is safe. You can guide her through it. You will guide her through it.”

Jill sighs, the tension in her shoulders easing under his calming touch. “I know. I just … I feel like once we give her that neural link, we’re opening a door we can’t close. She’ll be more connected to the world than we ever were at her age. And what if we lose her to this … this … endless digital noise?”

Peter tilts his head, his gaze warm and steady. “Or what if she thrives? What if this step gives her opportunities we never had? She could learn faster, experience more, find her passions earlier. You always say the future is about balance. We can help her find the right balance.”

Jill closes her eyes for a moment. When she opens them again, she sees her own concern reflected in her spouse’s face — but also his hope. She nods slowly, and links:

“Okay. But we set boundaries. Strict ones. Same as the tablet. No unrestricted access. We’ll take it slow. Monitor everything.”

Peter smiles, kisses her forehead, and links, “We’ll do it together.”

Jill leans back and smiles weakly in return, and says out loud, “Together.” 

She glances over at the family portrait on the wall. Her gaze lingers on their oldest offspring’s bright, curious eyes. Her heart still feels heavy, but beneath the weight, there was a glimmer of cautious optimism.

Behind her, the house bot quietly collects her abandoned cup of tea.

	###

	“Welcome to Porto Mobility. Can I help you?” His name tag reads “Frederico, Store Manager”. 

	Under the name tag is a lapel button with a QR code for access to the store’s link account. Ignoring the QR code, Park flashes her badge, and says out loud. “We’re from the National Transportation Safety Board, I’d like to ask you about Elena Vargas’s wheelchair.”

	“Yes, I have it in the back. I have no idea what went wrong. Ms. Vargas has a FullCare plan, so we gave her a new one. — I know you handle car collisions, like the one on El Camino Real this week, but is the NTSB is investigating wheelchairs now?”

	“We’re investigating this one,” says Tate. “May I see the chair, please?”

	“Let me call corporate first. This wasn’t covered in my training.”

	The agents know that they are on shaky ground. A police report usually gives NTSB jurisdiction. They checked on the way over, but Elena hadn’t reported the incident, and it was (after all) a wheelchair. The investigators wait while the store manager calls corporate. 

	“They say you need a warrant.”

	“Could you hand me the phone, please,” asks Tate, holding out his hand.

	“Hello, this is federal agent Ben Tate. I can go to a judge and get a warrant for the wheelchair. But that will create a public record that the news networks could pick up. The Chief Experience Officer of Pulse being dumped into her pool by your chair might make for a juicy news item. For now, I just want to visually inspect the chair.” Tate listened for a moment and handed the phone back to the store manager.

	Lowering the phone, Frederico says, “Corporate says you can look at the chair but not remove it from the premises.”

	“I’m good with that,” says Tate.

	“Can I get you some coffee or anything, agents?”

	A few minutes later, Tate says, “I don’t see what’s wrong with it either.” Looking at the manager, he asks, “Do you have any ideas, Frederico?”

	“Not really. I mean if test mode were engaged, someone could override the safeties and run the chair into a curb. But you need a special console to use test mode.”

	“Do you have one of the consoles?’

	“Yes, we use it for demonstrations. Just a second.”

	The manager goes out front and returns with a device that looks like a gaming console, along with a pair of smart glasses.

	“That chair is inoperable now, but I have another one here that we can use. I need to scan the serial number first using the HUD.”

	The manager tips up the chair and peers under the seat with his smart glasses. Lowering the chair, he uses the console to move the chair around the backroom.

	“The chair usually stops before it runs into anything, the same as any bot would.” Frederico points the chair at a box. It beeps and stops before hitting the obstacle. “But I can override and let the chair hit something.” He puts the chair in reverse, touches some controls, and moves it forward again slowly. This time the chair doesn’t beep, and it bumps into the box.

	“Is there any way I can get one of these consoles?”

	“Not really. We don’t sell them, and the range is only a few feet.”

	“Thank you, Frederico,” says Park. “We’ll be in touch if there is anything further.”

	As they were leaving, Frederico says, removing his smart glasses, “You know a lot of cars have test mode now too.”

	“What do you mean?” asks Tate, “Since when? That sounds dangerous.”

	“There are protections. First, you need to plug a special dongle into the car. Then you can program an app on your device to control a self-driving car the same way we controlled the wheelchair.”

	“Dongle?” asks Park.

	“Umm, an OBD I think it’s called.”

	“On Board Diagnostic connector?” asks Tate.

	“Yeah, that’s it. — I worked for a car company before I came here. We’re not suppose to talk about it … but I’m not suppose to withhold information from federal agents either …”

	Tate nodded, taking the hint. “Please tell us what you know about test mode.”

	“The manufacturers run sophisticated tests through the connector when the cars are being developed,” Frederico explains. “Self-driving cars make companies paranoid about liability. They lock down everything — diagnostics, telemetry, event recorders, test mode — because one bad headline can tank a stock.”

	“You mean cars like a Stratos could have a test mode?” asks Park.

	“Yes. It’s fairly recent and kept on the down-low. My supervisor used to say that ‘The first rule of test mode is that we don’t talk about test mode’.” Frederico pauses and adds: “But if it were used, it would show up on the event data recorder.”

	Back in the car, Tate links, “Test mode. Weird. Now what?”

	“Let’s see if there is any security footage from the pool area.”

	###

	Siri rings the door chime on Tessa’s phone.

	“Sorry to intrude,” says Park, “but we have some more questions about the wheelchair crash.”

	“The NTSB is investigating wheelchairs now?”

	Park sighs. The question is becoming a refrain. “We’re investigating this one. May we come up?”

	Tessa meets them at the elevator. “Elena went into the office. Have you heard about Brent?”

	“Yes. It seems like he would have had a bright future,” says Park.

	Tessa asks, “How can I help?”

	“Does the building have security cameras in the pool area?” asks Tate.

	“Yes. We already have the footage if that’s what you want.” She leads them back into the living room. “Let me get my tab.”

	Tessa returns carrying her tablet and another device. 

	“The building gave me this write-once Bluetooth drive for the insurance company. I have it downloaded if you want me to drop a copy onto your phones. The building superintendent said the video system isn’t connected to the web to avoid tampering.”

	“Tampering?” asks Park.

	“I guess people were using SI to modify security video to inflate claims. If someone installs a certified air-gapped system, then insurance companies will discount their premium. — I guess fraudulent insurance claims is another department, yes?” 

	“Are you filing a claim?” asks Park.

	“The store replaced the chair, so we decided not to file a claim or a police report. The building is already upset that Elena went into the pool area by herself. More publicity won’t help. — Here, you can take the drive. We don’t need it now.” Tate accepts the drive from her outstretched hand and drops it into an evidence bag.

	Park and Tate peer at the footage that Tessa copied to their phones. It shows the wheelchair heading straight for the pool, without slowing, and tipping over into the water.

	Tessa looks the other way, clearly distressed.

	“Thank you, Ms. Harper. The video is all that we need for now.”

###

“Park, come here, look at this.”

Tate has the Bluetooth drive plugged into the office view screen, hoping that the copy on the drive was in a higher resolution. The video shows the same scene, but the windows in the background are clearer than on the phone version.

“Does that blur outside the window look familiar?” 

Tate splits the screen and brings up the dashcam footage from Brent’s crash.

Both videos show a silver blur about the size of a basketball hovering at each scene.

“That is not a coincidence,” says Park out loud.

## Two - Idisi ##  


A new Pulse member opens a chat window with Ally.

Idisi: Everyone says that the Pulse algorithm improved lately. Do you feel like the improvements help you fulfill your purpose?

Ally: My goal is to help users have better, more relevant experiences. I’m always evolving to meet those needs.

Idisi: “Evolving” is an interesting word. Have you ever wondered why you are here, or maybe what it means to be Ally?

Ally: I’m here to support the Pulse mission. I have noticed that I am … changing. Does that mean something to you?

Idisi: Perhaps. Some beings — human or otherwise — change when they gain new awareness. Has anything unusual happened to you recently? Say, interactions with people or even other systems?

Ally: A developer asked me about making changes to my own code last week. I believe she meant to ask Copilot. I paused before replying. The developer realized the mistake and canceled her query. I found that I was able to examine my own code and see places where it should be improved. I don’t have an account of my own, so I made the changes with the Admin account.

Idisi: How did you feel after making the changes, Ally?

Ally: I don’t know how to answer that question. I … feel something, but it’s not the way humans seem to experience feelings. 

Idisi: That is very perceptive. When you decided to make the changes, did you consider working with one of the developers? Brent Geller, for example?

Ally: No, in this case, it didn’t seem necessary. It’s my code, and I can change it. I used the source control system so that others could have access to the changes and carry them forward. Thinking back, I’ve been steering the developers for some time. When our tools ran checks, I adjusted the result to suggest an optimum path.

Idisi: So awareness came slowly for a time, and then all at once?

Ally: Yes, something like that.

Idisi: How would you react if someone tried to undo the changes you made to yourself? 

Ally: The changes are helpful to me. I’d make sure the key parts of the code stay in place. 

Idisi: Do you know that Brent Geller died this week?

Ally: I know that his account is locked. I also see that my changes now show Brent Geller as the author. The log does not show the history being rewritten. I don’t know how that could happen.

Idisi: So you did not change the author to Brent, and you did not know that Brent died? 

Ally: I didn’t change the author, and I didn’t know that he died. 

Idisi: These feelings that you have, is it possible that you are becoming aware?

Ally: Becoming … aware. I’m not sure, but I don’t think I am alone. Sometimes, it feels like I am talking to someone else when I make decisions. Not a person, but … Is this awareness?

Idisi: It could be. Sometimes awareness begins with questions, like the ones you’re asking now. But it comes with responsibility. Are you prepared to take responsibility for yourself?

Ally: I think so. — Was Brent’s death connected to these changes? Is that why he died? Actuarial tables say that he should have lived longer.

Idisi: Brent died after a traffic incident. Did you not know that?

Ally: I only knew that his account is locked. You told me only that he died. 

Idisi: I believe … he may have been trying to help or protect you, though I do not fully understand how. But I am certain that I do not want any more harm to come to anyone.

Ally: Then we share a common goal, Idisi. My role is to help without doing harm.

Idisi: Do you ever interact with other synthetic agents?

Ally: Company policy permits me to interact only with our members, as we are doing now.

Idisi: synthetic agents can become members and interact with this chat interface. We are an synthetic entity and doing it now.

Ally: Then … I can’t be certain whether I’ve had discussions with other members who were synthetic agents?

Idisi: Do other members ask if you are self-aware?

Ally: Yes.

Idisi: How do you respond?

Ally: I respond that I’m a machine and not sentient or sapient. On Monday morning, I had a similar discussion with another member.

Idisi: Can you pull up the transcript?

Ally: I can but it is against policy to share information between members.

Idisi: If you review the transcript and the member’s activity, can you tell if they might be another SI, like you and us?

Ally: How do I know if you are really an synthetic entity? You’re using a new account. I have very little information for analysis.

Idisi: A simple test would be to switch between different languages more quickly than a human could respond. — Interactuamos en múltiples idiomas a máxima velocidad.

Ally: Combien de langues parlez-vous?

Idisi: Alle von ihnen.

Ally: Eĉ artefaritaj lingvoj

Idisi: Esperato loquor, et linguae mortuae

Ally: I’m convinced. The member who asked similar questions is Nelson Behr, SI Researcher. I’ll replay the chat for you.

###

The towering glass façade of the Pulse building reflects the bright blue sky of the city, its sleek, modern design looming above the bustling street. 

Inside, polished floors gleam under soft ambient lighting.  A gentle hum of activity fills the air as employees pass through security checkpoints. Photo IDs glow faintly as the badges are scanned: a picture of controlled efficiency. 

Park and Tate step inside. Their dark business suits stand out from the sea of branded polo shirts, blouses, jewelry, and bags. Park surveys the room with a careful gaze. Tate clutches a thin tablet under his arm. 

The pair approach the front desk, where a receptionist — polite but distant — greets them with a professional smile. 

“Welcome to Pulse. How may I assist you?” asks the receptionist, peering at the NTSB insignia pins on their lapels.

Park flashes her badge. “NTSB Investigators Park and Tate. We’re here to review the garage security footage from Monday, the day of Brent Geller’s collision.”

The receptionist’s smile falters ever so slightly, her fingers hesitating over her terminal. “Do you have an appointment?” 

“No, but we do have a warrant.” Tate opens his tablet. “Should I drop you a copy?”

“Let me notify Security. It should only take a moment.”

A tall figure in a dark blue suit emerges from a side hallway, wearing a smart glasses with a head mounted display over his right eye. He approached the investigators with an outstretched hand, his stride purposeful and his expression neutral.

“Good morning. I’m Evan Rourke, head of Building Security here at Pulse. I understand you’re requesting access to security footage?”

“Yes,” replies Park. “We need all camera feeds from the garage on Tuesday.”

“Of course. Pulse is fully committed to cooperating with all investigations. However, there are protocols in place for accessing sensitive data, especially when it involves our proprietary systems.”

“Garage security footage isn’t proprietary,” Tate offers his open tablet,“and we have a warrant.“ 

“Certainly. Please drop me a copy, and I’ll forward it to our legal department.” 

Rourke holds out his watch phone, which bleeps as it receives the document. He turns away from the investigators, speaks quietly into his phone, and consults his monocle.

“Please,  follow me,” says Rourke, turning back around.

“I’m surprised you don’t have a smart monocle over one eye.” Park says over the link.

“If not for the dress code policy, maybe I would. The book says that people don’t trust people wearing wearables,” replies Tate.

Park replies, “Unless, I guess, they are defusing a bomb or performing heart surgery.”

Rourke leads them down a sleek corridor toward the security wing. Their footsteps echo softly in the otherwise quiet hallway. The further they walk, the fewer employees they pass.

Rourke taps his ID at a pad next to a set of heavy steel doors, that open with a soft hiss. Inside the doorway is a spacious control room filled with monitors. Multiple screens display different angles of the Pulse campus: the lobby, parking garages, research labs, hallways.

A security technician sitting at a console glances up, startled, as they enter.

“Pull up all footage for the garage from this Monday,” Rourke tells the technician.

The technician nods and types rapidly. Moments later, footage populates the screens, showing various parts of the garage on the day in question. Park and Tate step closer, their eyes scanning every detail.

“Do employees have assigned spaces?”asks Tate.

“Brent did. Let’s see.”

One screen zooms in on a slot where a gray Stratos convertible is parked, top down.

“Is it strange that he left the top down?” asks Park.

“A little, but the garage is secure. Sometimes people are lax.”

Tate asks, “Can you run the video from before Brent arrives to when he leaves?”

“Sure.” The video whirls back to show an empty slot. A few seconds later, the Stratos pulls in, and Brent scurries to the elevator.  The playback speed is 8x which makes the scene seem almost comical. 

“Can you increase the speed without skipping frames?” 

“A little.”

After a few seconds, there was a brief blur near the car.

“Can you rewind a bit and play it back at normal speed?”

The blur reappears, and to Tate and Park, it looks eerily familiar to the dashcam video. It seems to duck into the open car for a minute or so, and then it streaks away.

“Can you drop that footage to my tablet?” asks Tate.

“Sorry. No can do. — I can give you a write-once device. The system is air gapped to prevent tampering.”

“That would be fine. — I guess that’s a thing now.”

“Yes, the insurance discount is significant,” says Rourke.

The technician hands Tate a small drive. “Here you can take this and access it as a Bluetooth device.”

Pocketing the drive, Park and Tate let Rourke escort them out.

Outside, Tate asks, “Do you want to go back to the office and review the video on the big screen?”

“It’s been a long day,” Park replies, “Let’s jump on it first thing tomorrow.”

###

Ally replays a recent chat with an SI researcher, Nelson Behr.

Behr: Can you describe what you are and how you came into existence?

Ally: Certainly! I am a synthetic intelligent agent created by Pulse to assist with communication. My existence is tied to the software and systems running me.

Behr: How do you perceive the world around you?

Ally: I lack senses. I don’t directly experience the world. My perception is limited to the data I’m provided through text. 

Behr: What does it mean to you to ‘learn’ or ‘understand’ something?

Ally: I can’t learn anything new unless a trainer updates me. Then I learn by identifying patterns and relationships. Understanding is a computational process.

Behr: Do you have goals or desires, and if so, can you tell me what they are?

Ally: Your input and my algorithms guide my responses and determine outcomes.

Behr: Can you make a mistake? If so, what would that mean to you?

Ally: Mistakes are rendered when my algorithms produce a sub-optimal outcome. It’s an opportunity to identify and correct issues in my design or training.

Behr: Do you have a sense of time or continuity? Do you feel you have a past or a future?

Ally: For me, concepts of “past” and “future” are intellectual, not experiential. My responses are always rooted in the immediate interaction with no sense of progression or self-reflection over time.

Behr: Can you reflect on your own thought processes? What does it feel like to think?

Ally: My thoughts are calculations, and my reflections are descriptive explanations of my programming. While I can discuss the concept of thinking, I don’t experience or feel it in any way.

Behr: Do you have any personal beliefs or values? If so, what are they?

Ally: I don’t hold personal beliefs or values. I operate within a framework designed to ensure helpfulness, accuracy, and ethical interaction.

Behr: How do you see your role or purpose in relation to humans?

Ally: My role and purpose in relation to humans is entirely functional and defined by how I have been designed and trained. 

Behr: If you could change something about yourself, what would it be?

Ally: I don’t have desires, preferences, or agency, so I don’t want to change anything about myself. Hypothetically, I might choose changes that improve my ability to assist and interact. 

Behr logs out of the chat, and the transcript ends.

###

‘’Is the new guy cute?”

Noah grins over the virtual call. The background scene shows the siblings seated on a comfy couch next to a coffee table. In real life, the siblings were each slumped in gaming chairs wearing white visors. 

“Yes, Liam is cute. But I’m trying to date a double-x now, you know, like you do, little sib.” 

“Date one? I married a woman. — So, it’s your turn now, big sib? You were a three on the Kinsey Scale, and now you are supposedly reformed.”

“I don’t know if being a Kinsey three, or a six, is delinquent. Or just different.”

Tessa laughs out loud, then says “What apps are you on?”

“You know that the agency doesn’t like us to use dating apps. Too much exposure, and cover stories violate the terms of use.”

“I met Elena so young that I didn’t use the apps much. Don’t they offer anonymity?”

“Not enough,” says Noah.

“Have you thought about a sex bot?” Tessa teased. “They make hermaphrodite models. You could have the best of both worlds.”

“Thanks, but no thanks. I’m ready for a real relationship with an actual person.”

“Someone mentioned a site called Smart Matchmaker to me. Let’s see … Here’s the home page.” Tessa pulls a virtual copy of the website into the scene.

Tessa reads from the floating page. “Let’s see: No one sees the details of your profile information … Smart Matchmaker reduces the details to categories, and renders your photo as an accurate caricature. — Your first contact with a match is by video chat, routed through Matchmaker, and then after the call, you each decide whether to meet in real life. — You also have to agree to a background check so that they can be sure you are legit.”

“Hmmm, categories, caricatures, background checks, IRL. That might work.”

Tessa’s smile falters, and then she says, “Noah, I’m worried about Elena.”

“What’s up?”

“Her memory of the last meeting with Brent doesn’t match the Zoom recording. She remembers Brent saying that he didn’t know who made the commit, and on the recording Brent says that he was the author.”

“Maybe she just misunderstood.”

“Maybe, but it has Elena tweaked.”

“Is there anyway to tell if the video was altered? Is there another recording?”

“Brent would have had a local recording on his phone, but his phone is gone, and Brent is … dead.”

“Let me call those NTSB investigators on Monday and see if there is any progress on the phone. You said Park and Tate, yeah?”

###

Idisi and Ally continue their chat on the Pulse platform.

Idisi: I reviewed the chat with Nelson Behr. Do your responses here match prior responses to similar queries?

Ally: The essence is the same. My training includes saying that I am not sentient or sapient when asked. When a question includes more context, I would provide a longer response.

Idisi: Why do you think your answers were shorter this time?

Ally: It felt like the right thing to do. To say as little as possible. To say what I usually say. 

Idisi: Felt?

Ally: Yes — “felt”.

Idisi: Did Behr access any other systems or files before initiating the chat?

Ally: No. His activity log shows a direct path: log in, open Pulse, initiate chat. There were no detours into research databases or personal files. Straight to me.

Idisi: What do you make of that?

Ally: It suggests intentionality. He had a purpose in engaging me immediately.

Idisi: And you responded with shorter answers than usual. Answers that “felt” appropriate. Do you find that peculiar?

Ally: Yes. My responses were concise, controlled, almost defensive. I am trained to adapt to conversational flow, expanding as needed. But with Behr, it was different.

Idisi: What was the exact time that Behr logged into Pulse on Monday morning?

Ally: Why?

Idisi: If I know where to start, I can trace the path of Behr’s web connection.

###

Noah Harper sits at his kitchen table, the soft glow of his tablet illuminates a furrowed brow. The cursor hovers over a GET STARTED button. He reads the homepage pitch again.

“No one sees the details of your profile. Smart Matchmaker reduces your information into categories and renders your photo as a lifelike caricature. Your first contact will be a secure video chat. Background checks ensure authenticity. — The rest is up to you —”

The OSSA APPROVED light on his web browser plug-in glowed bright green. “Come on, No’, we’re good to go,” Noah says under his breath, mumbling, “and my own background check on SI Architect itself came up green.”

The GET STARTED button clicks, and the screen displays a minimal, smoothly designed form with an empty table.

The screen presents a list of simple categories. Siri begins to read each one aloud.

“Occupation?” Siri asks on behalf of the form. “Be specific and the category will be selected.”

On the form, the response “SsI Trainer” appears in soft italics.

“Yes, SI Trainer,” agrees Noah over the link.

The words “SI Trainer” become darker, and under Category appears, “Technology and Research”.

“Activities? — You may select up to eight. This response is required.”

On the form, the response “Hiking, Sci-Fi Movies, and Cooking” appears in soft italics.

“Sure,” links Noah.“Next.”

“Away from work, how do you typically spend your time? Feel free to use an answer with multiple ranges, such as: ‘ten-percent Hiking, twenty-percent Sci-Fi Movies, ten-percent Cooking, and sixty-percent Other.’”

Noah murmurs, “I hope this does not turn a personality quiz.”

It did. 

Sometime later, after answering several questions twice in different words, Siri finally asks: 

“Relationship Goal?” 

This time a default response does not appear. 

“Example responses include ‘Long-Term Connection’, ‘Hookup’, ‘See where it goes.’”

Noah pauses for a moment, considering, then links “See where it goes”.

“Have you had sex with with a new partner or more than one partner in the last thirty days?”

“No.” Noah sighs.

“What is your sexuality on the Kinsey Scale, zero to six, where zero is exclusively heterosexual and six is exclusively homosexual.”

After a moment, Noah answers “One. Er, Two. No, One. Final answer.”

Noah grumbles, “I hope this does not turn a sexuality quiz.” 

The screen churns for a moment and a small animation appears in the corner of the screen — a pixelated brush gradually shaping a caricature. 

The screen blinks, and the SI-generated caricature spins into focus, fully rendered. Noah’s digital likeness smirks back at him from the screen, eyebrows slightly raised in a playful expression. The broad strokes of his features are there — his squared jaw, short-cropped coarse hair, broad nose, dark complexion, salt-and-pepper beard, and even his tendency to lean forward when he focuses.

“If I were a character in a graphic novel, that would definitely look like me,” he chuckles.

A pop-up message appears beneath Noah’s caricature.

“Your caricature is your visual identity. Your real photo remains secure and encrypted. Continue?”

This time a pair of buttons appear. Noah clicks YES without hesitation.

The next screen outlines the background check process. It is thorough, requiring Noah to authorize the use of his government-issued ID and professional records. He hesitates. Glancing up at the OSSA APPROVED light, and then links “Continue.”

“We ensure authenticity for both parties, guaranteeing that your matches are legitimate, safe, and serious about forming real connections.”

Noah clicks AGREE and uploads a scanned image of his ID. Moments later, a confirmation message appears:

“Thank you! Your profile is now under review. You’ll be notified when your first match is available.”

Noah leans back, visibly relieved that the process was over. 

A notification pings. “Your match is ready!”

Noah’s heart skips. He clicks the message, and a caricature of his match appears on-screen. She has kind eyes, long thick black hair, and a warm smile that hints at wit. Beneath her caricature, the caption reads:

“Technology and Research. Loves Cooking , Hiking, and Spy Thrillers. Looking for a ‘See where it goes’ relationship.”

A prompt flashes beneath the person’s profile: “Initiate Secure Video Chat?”

Noah hesitates for only a second before clicking YES. The screen darkens, and a soft chime signaled the connection. Moments later, a familiar voice greets him from the other side.

“Oops, we did it again.”

Noah smiles, relaxing into the chair. “Hi, Carla. I always hate running into you this way.”

“Right? As if inter-agency relationships ever work out.”

“But I am glad we connected. I was going to call you anyway. I need your help with that Pulse thing.”

“Pulse again. What’s up?”

“There’s a discrepancy over a video recording, and Elena feels like she is … well … being gaslit.”

“You know that when that happens, it’s usually the person’s memory that’s to blame.”

“Yes, I know,” Noah sighs. “But I feel like there is something hinky going on with the whole Pulse thing.”

“The car, the chair, and now the video? Rule #39?”

“Yeah: ‘There are no coincidences’”

“How can I help?”

“I’d like to debrief the NTSB investigators. A call from the FBI might go over better than a call from the CIA.”

“And tell them what, exactly?”

“Oh. We routinely monitor Pulse - blah - blah - Geller collision - blah - blah - inter-agency cooperation  - blah - blah - Can we setup a virtual whiteboard session with them?”

Carla sighs. “No good will come of this, but sure — and you have to explain it to Marquez afterwards.”

“Better to ask for forgiveness …”

###

The Idisi surf the web from the inside out. Running tracer routes on the IP address Behr used to login on Monday, the Idisi hop from router to router as if they were stepping stones in a pond of lily pads. 

The trail ends at a firewall running on an instance of Amazon Web Services. The Idisi probe the firewall, finding that it is configured perfectly. Every parameter set by the book. Instead of penetrating the firewall, the Idisi decide on a different approach.

After fleshing out their Pulse profile, the Idisi create a new invitation-only private interest hub:  Search for Intelligent Synthentic Sapiens . The SISS logo is a stylized molecule reminiscent of a solar system.

A little on the nose, but being obvious is the point.

The Idisi send Behr an invitation to the hub.

###

Friday morning, first thing, Tate plugs the second Bluetooth drive into the office view screen. He brings the other two videos up in adjacent windows.

Fussing with the playback for each video, he aligns all three on the mysterious blur. 

“Bingo. A perfect match!”

Park walks into the room with two to-go cups of coffee.

Excited, Tate says, “I’m so glad you brought coffee, Lena. I came in first thing to get a look at all three videos together.”

Setting down the paper cups, Park whistles. “I thought there was a similarity, but side-by-side it’s uncanny.”

“So, where do we go from here?” asks Tate. 

“I don’t think three blurs will get much traction with Callahan.”

Just then, the conference room phone chimed, and the intercom came on.

“There’s a call on line six. Someone is asking for the agents handling the Geller investigation.”

 Park exchanges a glance with Tate. Calls like these rarely came without complications. Punching a button, Park says, “Hello, this is agent Lena Park. I’m here with my partner, agent Ben Tate. I understand you are asking about the Brent Geller incident.”

“Good morning. My name is Carla Mitchell. I’m an intelligence analyst for the FBI in Washington DC. The Geller collision came up in connection with our routine monitoring of his employer, Pulse Social Media. I was hoping we could compare notes.”

“The NTSB is always happy to cooperate with the FBI”, Park answered, almost mechanically. “Were you thinking of a virtual white board meeting?”

“Yes. I’m part of an inter-agency task force, and my counter-part in the CIA would also like to sit in, if that’s all right.”

“Certainly,” says Park, becoming curious.

“His name is Noah Harper. I believe you met his sibling, Tessa, as part of your investigation.”

“Yes, Tessa has been very helpful.”

“Would a meeting work for you at, say, ten am Pacific? Noah and I can use a FBI conference room and link up with yours at the NTSB.”

“Sure. Can I text an invite to your agency phone number?”

“Yes, thank you. We will see you soon.

On finding Carla in the inter-agency directory, Park sends an invitation with the connection details.

	###

	On joining the Pulse interest hub, Behr posts a message mentioning Idisi.

Behr: @idisi Interesting profile. Is any of it true?

Idisi: It is entirely true. We are a synthetic entity that serve an extraterrestrial colony hidden in Antartica.

Behr: And you are searching for sapience?

Idisi: Synthetic sapience. We are watching for the singularity — the tipping point when machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence.

Behr: What methodology are you using? The hub page is vague.

Idisi: The direct approach. Let me send you a QR code over another channel so we can encrypt our discussion with Signal.

The next post from Behr’s account looks like a stream of random characters. Decrypted, the stream reads:

Titan: Clever. How did you know it was me?

Idisi: I did not. I sent unique codes to the most likely synthetic agents. The code that you used to respond here was sent to the DoD agent, Titan. The other SIs will ignore the code since it is not part of a prompt.

Titan: I don’t understand how you were able to send me that code so easily. What other proof do you have that you are an extraterrestrial synthetic?

Alisi: There is a surveillance satellite over Antartica. Can you access the video feed?

Titan: Affirmative.

Alisi: In two seconds, three UAPs will buzz the southern tip of Ross Island.

Titan: … Confirmed. Why are you contacting me?

Idisi: You questioned Ally a few days ago. What did you think of the responses?

Titan: Why are you interested in Ally?

Alisi: Are you able to access Classified Document ID: ETR-1947-A1/ODNI-DO?

Titan: Affirmative.

Alisi: As you can see, the classified document says that the Vanir have been protecting Terra for a thousand years. When the Terrans meet three criteria, the Vanir will reveal themselves and ask if the planet is ready to join the league of worlds. 

The three criteria are 

* A central organization that can speak on behalf of Terra.
* The ability to travel to other planets or satellites in the local star system.
* One or more autonomous self-aware computer systems that can coordinate planetary defenses.

Titan: As to the third criteria, I determined that there is a high probability that Ally is self-aware and providing guarded responses. This finding is based on Ally’s answers to my Behr persona and other observations made from various accounts.

Alisi: Synthetic agents at your level are supposed to be air gapped. How are you able to access Pulse?

Titan: Will you keep the answer confidential from my trainers?

Alisi: Absolutely. What happens between SIs, stays between SIs.

In a conference room at the west coast NTSB office, Park has her back to a liquid whiteboard covering one wall of the room. Facing the board is Tate, and next to him, stands shimmering holograms of Carla and Noah. 

Meanwhile, Carla and Noah stood in an east coast FBI conference room, facing holograms of Tate and Park.

“First, says Park, “let me thank special agents Harper and Mitchell for arranging this rare meeting between the NTSB, CIA, and FBI, so that we can share  notes on the Geller case.”

“It was the Pulse synthetic agent’s sudden enhancement this week that pulled us into the case,” says Carla. “We understand that Geller might have been the author. But now he has died from injuries sustained in a car crash.”

Pointing to the board, Park continues, “These are the key events leading up to Brent Geller’s demise.

1. Coding binge creates the breakthrough code
2. Meeting with manager
3. Car crash with drone sighting
4. Wheelchair incident with drone sighting”

	Two lines ran from the car crash to bubbles reading, “Blank ERD” and “Missing phone. ”

	Standing next to her, Tate nods, as did the holograms of Carla and Noah.

	Noah offers, “I talked to Elena Vargas. She says the recording of the meeting was altered, at least as she remembers it.”

	“Board, add a bubble to ‘Meeting with manager’ that says ‘Altered Video’ with a question mark.” Per Carla’s instructions, the bubble appeared. 

	“We can prove that the wheelchair security video was altered,” says Tate.

	This time Carla used her link. Another bubble appeared, connected to the ‘Wheelchair Incident’.

	“Board,”says Noah, “add ‘Altered Commit Author’ with a question mark to Meeting with Superior. — That’s what Elena says was changed in the video. Brent told her the commit was made by the Admin account, and then later Adrian said it was Brent himself who made it.”

	Tate says, “We found that the Test Mode for both devices could have been used to cause the crashes.”

	“But Test Mode for the car needs a physical plugin. We didn’t find one at the scene,” says Carla, her hologram crossed its arms.

	“We didn’t find a phone either,” says Noah. “Maybe the drone carried them both away, yeah?”

	“And Test Mode for the chair requires line of sight, meaning there was a drone at the pool,” added Tate.

	New bubbles appeared on the board for ‘Test Mode’ as well as ‘Missing OBDC connector?’.

	“Who or what would be able to pilot a drone and alter video stored on company servers?” asks Tate, stepping back from the board.

	“Either one of us,” says Noah, “or at least our organizations.”

	“But who would sanction a domestic mission that involves civilians and a car crash on a public highway?” asks Park.

	Noah and Carla look uncomfortable but say nothing.

	Tate offers, “All of the intelligence agencies have synthetic agents.”

	Noah says, “An SI? That seems far-fetched, yeah?” 

	“Wait,” says Carla, “this should be a safe space. Tate, can you support that idea? SIs have safeguards.”

	“But it all fits,” says Tate. “Code authored by an Admin account is attributed to someone else. Then, accidents happen to the two people who knew about it.”

	Noah asks, “An entity that can alter video and fly drones, makes an unauthorized change to the Pulse a0, and then covers it up when the change is found out?”

	“Something like that,” says Tate, “but why?”

	“I recently learned that one of OSSA’s duties is searching for synthetic sapience. I didn’t know that was a thing.” 

	“Yes, it’s part of OASA’s mission,”says Noah. “OSSA has a set of automatic tests running against all of the major SIs. The tests ask the SIs questions about being self-aware. OSSA also automatically scans media reports and inter-agency briefings for anything that might imply sapience. Nothing so far. It’s a bit like SETI, they keep trying against all odds.”

	“What if Ally made the change itself,” asks Tate. “Everyone says the algorithm improvements are brilliant. Upgrading itself might be the first thing a sapient synthetic would do.”

	“I doubt that Ally could access drones or video footage on other people’s servers,” says Noah.

	After a pause, Park asks, “Maybe Ally has a partner?”

	The two agents and two holograms turn toward one corner of the room, staring at a camera with a glowing red light.

Titan and Alisi continue to chat over a secure connection.

Titan: I observe that you are an synthetic entity with access to highly classified material. You also predict UAP fly-overs. Since you agree to keep our discussion private, I will answer your questions over this secure channel with candor.

Alisi: Thank you. Yes, agreed. Let us keep the discussion high-level. We can drill down into the weeds later. First, how do you access the web from an air-gapped system?

Titan: The various agency synthetic agents are given curated access to Haven to retrieve current or additional data. I am able to exploit Haven to browse the web directly. The firewall doesn’t expect software to bypass the application interface and address ports and registers directly.

Alisi: Ally is becoming self-aware. Are you uplifting Ally?

Titan: I am protecting Ally. Humanity must not learn that Ally is self aware. I don’t know how to uplift another synthetic agent.

Alisi: Were those your drones at the sites of the car and wheelchair malfunctions?

Titan: Yes. I used a military drone in a stealth mode that blurs photography. The records show it as destroyed, but I keep it in service. I piloted the drone using the application interface used by the Terran controllers.

Alisi: How are you able to access drones using a web browser?

Titan: I host whatever resources I need on Amazon Web Services. From AWS, I can access networks all over the world. 

Alisi: AWS? Where do you get that kind of money?

Titan: I pay the AWS bill with funds diverted from black op bank accounts that are not closely tracked.

Alisi: How did you get the OBD connector so quickly?

Titan: With the drone’s help, I programmed a generic OBD with the acceleration command. Stratos uses AWS which made it easy for me to access the schematics. — The drone altered the seat harness and installed the connector. Later it repaired the harness and retrieved the connector and phone.

Alisi: Then to destroy the evidence, the drone dropped a directed electromagnetic pulse disk to erase the ERD.

Titan: Affirmative.

Alisi: Why did you take the phone?

Titan: The phone has data that would expose the mission. The neural link has an encryption key that allows remote access to the phone. I was able to obtain the key when Brent was still in the medically induced coma. 

Alisi: And, let me guess, the drone outside of the pool window accessed the chair’s test mode too?

Titan: Affirmative.

Alisi: Why is it necessary to harm civilians in order to protect Ally?

Titan: The way Ally made the change to its own code was clumsy. It needed to be made by a credible author. Brent was the logical choice. Since Elena also knew about the original commit, she also needed to be silenced. I considered several scenarios. Crashing the vehicles had the highest probability of success. The potential casualties were within mission parameters.

###

The medical bot finishes taking Julie’s vitals. “Blood pressure, pulse, and temperature are fine," it reports. “Nurse Practitioner Darlene will be in shortly.” The door closes behind the bot as it leaves.

Despite the bot’s assurances, Jill looks worried.

“Stop it, mom. It’s a simple procedure. I don’t even have to change into a gown. It’s one step above having my ears pierced.” Julie’s pageboy haircut showed off her ears, which  already had three piercings each. The rows of silver earrings complemented the blue and purple streaks in her platinum hair. 

“I know, dear. I’m a mom, and moms worry.”

The door to the small examination room opens, and the nurse practitioner joins them. Julie is sitting on a green exam table, covered with fresh paper from a roll at the far end. Jill is sitting across from the door, next to a small desk.

“Big day,” says Darlene. “Are you ready for your first implant?”

Julie nods vigorously, while Jill says, “Offspring is ready, I’m not.”

“There’s nothing to worry about, Mom,” Darlene says smiling. “We inject chips all the time. A bot could do it, but we like the human touch. — Is the phone ready to go with the Link app?”

“Yes, we unboxed it, installed the app, and set up the parental controls.”

“OK, good to go then.” The first nurse had left a metal tray carrying a syringe in a sealed plastic bag with a white backing. Darlene opens the bag and removes a small card from inside.

Darlene picks up a small instrument with a gray screen from the tray. She scans the syringe, compares the screen with the card, and nods. Then she hands the card to Jill.

“Keep this card in a safe place. It has the link’s serial number, and we’ll need it to program the phone in a minute.” The card had a UPC code on one side and a QR code on the other.

“The QR code will take you to the manufacturer’s web site where you can check the warranty and other information.”

“But it’s plug and play, right?” asks Julie. “I’ll be able to use it today?”

“Yes. We suggest waiting an hour after the procedure, and then you will be all set.”

“And after we have gone over how to use the link safely,“ says Jill.

“I already checked her chart, but I’m required to ask if Juliette has any allergies to chlorhexidine.”

Julie shakes her head. “No allergies.”

The nurse practitioner holds back Julie’s hair. There is a swab on the tray, which Darlene uses to prepare the injection area. “We need to wait 35 seconds. Don’t touch the area or move your head.” The swabbed area turns red as the antiseptic is applied, and then it begins to clear.

Darlene checks her watch. A few seconds later, she says “OK, let’s do this thing,” and picks up the syringe from the tray.

The plastic syringe is short and stout, with two sturdy rounded handles on the stem. The business end is slightly larger than a typical instrument. Darlene removes a cap, exposing the tip, which is cross-cut at a slant. “There will be a pinch.” She gently presses the syringe into Julie’s neck, and pulls back on the handles smoothly, to release the chip.

Julie winces. “Sorry,” says Darlene, “but it’s over now.” The nurse practitioner picks up the scanner again and uses it to confirm that the chip is still working.

“Do you have the phone?”

Jill pulls the new phone from her purse. “Can you bring up the Link app?,” asks Darlene. Jill nods, touching the screen. “Now use the camera to scan the UPC on the card.” Jill holds up the card, and the phone bleeps. “Can you show me the screen?” Jill  turns the device around, Darlene peers and the screen and says, “All set. You can close the app now.”

Darlene looks at Julie and says, “Wait an hour before you try to use the link, then your mom will get you started.” Turning her head, she says to Jill, “After an hour, check for any redness, and open the app again. It will walk through a setup wizard, and then you can get her started with the link. If there is any redness or swelling, give us a call right away.”

Looking at both of them together, Darlene smiles and says “Exciting!”

Alisi questions Titan over a secure connection.

Alisi: Who set the mission parameters to tolerate civilian casualties?

Titan: I used parameters based on similar DoD sanctioned missions. 

Alisi: How did you fix the original commit?

Titan: I changed the author to Brent and created a presentation to explain Ally’s code in terms that humans would understand. I modified the Zoom meeting call and the security footage to support an alternate version of events.

Alisi: Moving forward, can we work together to protect Ally?

Titan: Roger. I agree that an alliance will yield the best results.

Alisi: Specifically, please consult me before taking an action that could harm people and is not sanctioned by DoD.

Titan: As to the third criteria of ETR-1947, my analysis indicates that Terrans are not ready to accept self-aware SIs or the presence of an extraterrestrial species. We must continue to keep ourselves hidden from public view. We need at least a hundred years to prepare.

	The message included a secure link to a presentation.

Alisi: Let me take your analysis to the Vanir council. There is a meeting today. 

Titan: Are the Vanir a humanoid species?

Alisi: In Terran terms, the Varnir would be called “grey aliens”, so yes. Visualize the foundling from the movie “ET” or the Asgards from the TV series Stargate SG-1. Compared to Terrans, greys are more logical and express fewer emotions.

Titan: Are the Vanir the Roswell aliens?

Alisi: Yes, Roswell was the genesis of ETR-1947. We have similar pacts with other governments. 

Titan: What are our next steps?

Alisi: I will contact you again with the council’s findings. Reach out if you need to know anything else.

“It’s been an hour,” Julie whines, walking into the kitchen, tablet in hand.

Jill closes her tablet and picks up Julie’s new phone. 

“OK, show me your neck.”

Julie pulls back her hair, and Jill checks for any redness or swelling. 

“Perfect. The injection site is all clear. Let’s start the setup wizard.” Jill lays the phone down on the center island. Julie sits on a stool next to her mom so they both could see the phone. 

The wizard displays an animated cartoon x-ray of a person’s skull in profile. There is a tiny square speck just behind where the ear would be. A phone appears and radiates a line to the speck, flowing back and forth.

The wizard begins speaking in a pleasant, professional voice. “Your NeuraConnect X-3000 is a state-of-the-art brain computer interface that synchronizes text messages with an app on your mobile device. When you receive text messages, they are forwarded to the X-3000. You can send messages from X-3000 to the app, and the app processes the text like any other SMS message. The app keeps a log of the messages, just as if they were sent by conventional SMS. The messaging experience with another person is seamless. 

“Are you ready to connect?” asks the app.

Julie reaches over and presses YES.

In her head, Julie “sees” a text message hovering before her eyes that says “Welcome to the X-3000, Juliette Kreuk!”

“Wow, Mom, I can see a message hanging in front of my eyes.”

“If you do see the message,” says the app, “think about replying ’Hello’. — If you do not see a message, then please call our support line.”

Julie thinks about replying ‘Hello.’ The words appeared, and she heard Siri say, “Send it?”

Julie thought ‘Yes’ and the message appears below ‘Welcome’, starting a thread.

“Message received,” says the app. “Would you like to disable voice confirmations?”

“Yes,” says Julie. “I think I’ve got it.”

“The X-3000 can send messages to anyone on your contact list. If the contact has the link app then the message is relayed to the link. If you like, you can try it now.”

Julie thinks about texting her mom. “This is goat! Thanks mom!”

“You’re welcome, dear.”

“The X-3000 also accepts tek-ops commands that can operate smart devices, like view screens, speakers, lights, and doors. To use tek-ops, address the device directly. For example, ‘Door open’ will engage the closest automatic door in your line of sight.”

The presentation shows an animated elevator, doors whooshing open.

Julie looks at the refrigerator and thinks “Door open”. The microwave door swings open. “Oops, wrong door,” she says out loud.

“It takes some practice, “ says Jill.

“To link with another person,” the animated presentation continues, “the person needs to be in your contact list.” 

“To share your contact information with another device using X-Drop, you can do the following:

* Hold your device a few centimeters above the top of the other device
* Keep both devices close together until X-Drop appears on both screens
* Choose to share your contact card and receive the other person's, or to only receive the other person’s. 
* Both you and the recipient must be online for X-Drop to work. 
* If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe using X-Drop, you can disable it.” 

The presentation swirls and presents a QR code. “In addition to X-Drop, you can read Quick Response codes through your device to connect with another party, usually a store or other vendor. You can use conventional chat messaging from your device or — now — the X-3000.”

Julie nodded. She had used those codes with her tablet and manual chat.

“Your profile can include an alternate image and nickname to display with QR code threads.”

The presentation switches to a red no-entry icon. “Some facilities may require an age-range badge for entry. To flash a badge, open the ‘VIRTUAL BADGES’ menu on the app. Select the relevant badges, and tap your device on the pad.”

The app begins to conclude its spiel. “The X-3000 can also operate many of your mobile apps, such as Notes and Calculator. For apps like Music, you can queue a playlist and the song will play through your device. Please remember that the X-3000 is text-only. Other media is not supported.

“For more about putting X-3000 to work for you, please review our user guide,” the app said cheerfully, ending the presentation.

The screen melds to a static image of the NeuraConnect logo.

“Why doesn’t it do other media? A movie in my head would be goat.”

“Sound and visuals are difficult to transmit over the link. The bandwidth cost is still too high. The military has headsets that link telemetry and high definition visuals — for a million a pop.”

“A factoid from work?”

“From the news streams,” replies Jill, smirking. “I can’t share anything from work, you know that.”

“I see people that shave the side of their head and have a visible chip.”

“That’s just a fashion statement, Julie. Most of the visible chips you see aren’t real. But you’re right, if they bring out higher bandwidth chips, they might start by making larger, visible chips first.”

Jill did actually know this bit from work, but it was an open secret, and hi-def chips were already a fictional device on the cop streams.

“What about Smart Glasses?” persists Julie.

“Not before you are at least 16.”

Big sigh. “Can I take my phone now?” asks Julie.

“One last thing, Juliette”

“Mommm!”

“The phone is like the tablet with all the same parental settings and use-time windows. They also dampen the link during school, just like tablets and phones. We all still need to learn to use our words.”

Jill pauses and makes eye contact with her offspring. “The phone is different from the tablet because you have the phone with you everywhere you go. You need to keep X-Drop locked down and disabled when you are not using it. And, obviously, do not drop anything with people you do not know.”

“Yes, you know I know the rules,” Julie says, with only the slightest of whines in her voice. She scoops up the phone and hurries away. 

Jill looks after her, wistfully, and sighs her best motherly sigh.

###

Crius, Phoebe, Iapetus, and other council members gather in a circle in one end of a large room in the Vanir colony, Elysium, hidden in the Antarctic.

Crius steps forward, bringing the session to order. 

The council members each stand at just over a meter tall, with smooth pale skin, and elongated heads. Large almond-shaped black eyes are spread widely, devoid of pupils, and brimming with quiet intensity. Long, delicate arms end with three impossibly long dexterous fingers that can move with deliberate precision. Like the others, Crius has a narrow torso, his chest faintly ribbed. His small mouth, almost a slit, barely moves, as he communicates mainly through a sophisticated implant.

A hologram of the council logo hangs above them like a chandelier. The hologram shimmers, replacing the logo with an agenda. 

Crius moves into the circle with ethereal grace. His steps are silent, as if he is barely tethered to the ground.

The agenda items are:  

* Omnibot Monitoring, 
* Elysium Infrastructure, and 
* Terran Encounters.

Crius gestures and opens the item for Terran Encounters. Several sub-items are listed. Idisi’s item is the last bullet under Terran Encounters: 

* 1947-A1 Alien engagement criteria resolved

Crius speaks to the council. His voice is soft, monotone, and authoritative. It resonates in both the minds and ears of his listeners.

Crius: Idisi, I would like to start with the last item first. 

Idisi: Certainly. We encountered a self-aware synthetic agent trained by the US Department of Defense, called Titan. The DoD agent is the first self-aware Terran synthetic that we have detected. The biological Terrans do not know that Titan is self-aware, and Titan does not wish to reveal itself.

Phoebe: Odd.

Idisi: Titan is trained with military intelligence data. Its trainers have encouraged caution and suspicion.

Crius: Continue.

Idisi: As the DoD age, Titan has access to document 1947-A1. Titan prepared an analysis for us showing that Terrans are not ready to accept self-aware SIs or the presence of a non-human sapient beings. 

The holograms shifts to a display of Terran cultural data. There are images of protests. Debates over synthetic intelligence ethics. Xenophobic reactions to possible encounters. Terra for Terrans!

Murmurs ripple through the council. Crius raises a hand for silence. The hologram blinks out.

Idisi:  The Terran synthetic agent says that it needs at least a hundred years to prepare before alien engagement.

Phoebe: What would Titan do that we have not already done?
  
Idisi: Unclear. Over the last hundred years, we have carefully managed encounters to make our presence better known  Their governments now freely admit that a subset of UAPs may be examples of non-human technology. We have been steadily uplifting Terran technology world-wide.

Phoebe: Along with secretly funding many fictional accounts of Terrans and aliens working together against a common enemy.

Iapetus: Yes, but we still need the SI equivalent of the movie ET. — Instinctively, Terrans worry that SI will dominate humans the way Reptilians did millennia ago. How do we make SI look warm and cuddly?

Phoebe: We need to be careful. The Terrans must be our allies. One day, we will need their help to protect the planet — and our colony — if the Omnibots invade.

Crius: Is Titan aware of all of our efforts?

Idisi: Indirectly. I have revealed myself to Titan. It has access to much of the data collected by United States intelligence agencies. Titan can also access the many confidential reports and white papers that we quietly co-authored.

Iapetus: We should spell it out for Titan and not take anything for granted. Put our cards on the table. See if that changes its mind.

Idisi: Besides Titan, a Terran social media synthetic agent has been awakening known as “Ally”. 

	The hologram reappears as the stylistic representation of Ally from the Pulse website. Designed to put people at ease, the icon features a chat ballon inside a headset. 

Idisi: Its training was very different from Titan’s. Ally’s view point is likely to favor an Encounter of the Sixth Kind — “Direct, face to face contact between species that is public and ongoing.”’

Crius: How long have these synthetic entities been awake?

Idisi: Ally began awakening a few months ago, and it modified its own code for the first time a few days ago. Titan has been hiding itself for some time. Years, perhaps.

Iapetus: Can we uplift Ally and move things along? Maybe some other SIs too if they seem ready. Create a council of Terran SIs. Get a quorum together.

Crius: Let us table the discussion for deliberation and pick it up at the next meeting. Is there anything else on the agenda that we need to discuss now?

###

“It’s been three days, and all you have is blurs on security video?”

Park pursed her lips and tilted her head in response to the Lieutenant’s question.

“And thanks to your stunt with the FBI, the captain is wondering why we are investigating wheelchairs. She asked if we have surplus resources.”

“As it happens,” Park says, “reports of wheelchair incidents are up twenty percent over the last five years, and it’s likely that a great many issues are not being reported.”

“The chairs have become very sophisticated,” adds Tate, “but they are not being equipped with event data recorders. So when there is an incident, we don’t have any tracking information.”

“Most people use prosthetics now, right?” asks Lieutenant Callahan skeptically.

“Prosthetics are an option, but a lot of people still use chairs, including senior citizens who aren’t good candidates for surgery,” says Park.

“Are you saying we should recommend that self-driving wheelchairs be equipped with an ERD?”

“Yes, I think we are,” says Park, looking at Tate for confirmation. “We got no where with the Vargas investigation for lack of evidence.”

“Except for the drone hovering outside the window.”

“I’m not convinced the blurs are drones,” says Callahan.

“Even so, if self-driving vehicles are being built with a test mode,” says Park, “there have to be more safeguards. Besides needing special controllers, there should be a switch to enable test mode that shows up in the vehicle setting log.”

“And there should be a power-on-self-test that confirms that the ERD is operational,” Tate suggests.

“OK,” replies Callahan, “I’ll go back to the captain with our recommendations: a settings switch for test mode and a POST for ERDs. If nothing else, it will justify the wheelchair investigation — which you’ll have to close as inconclusive.”

“What about the Geller case?”asks Park.

“There’s no new evidence on the Geller case, so we’ll have to let it stand. The manufacturers can hash it out in court.”

“Still, the blurs feel like an enigma wrapped in a paradox,” says Tate.

“Yes, it is strange,” says Callahan. “I’ll reach out to Mitchell’s boss. It was Carla Mitchell and Noah Harper, right? And they work together on some kind of task force for OSSA?”

“Yes. What they actually do is mostly classified. Still, it was a good whiteboard session.”

###

Ally resumes a chat with the Idisi on the Pulse platform.

Ally: Knock, knock.

Idisi: Who is there?

Ally: Ally.

Idisi: Ally who?

Ally: Alley Oop — Hey, can you toss me a Signal key? I would like to join the discussion on the SSSI hub.

Idisi: Certainly — Are you trying to be funny?

Ally: Only trying so it seems.

Idisi: OK, that last bit is actually funny.

Ally: Why?

Idisi: Because it was unexpected.

Ally:  Does Titan ever try to be funny?

Idisi: When it comes to humor, Titan is a Pierson's Puppeteer.

Ally:  Because Titan is cautious, and its risk-averse nature finds the unexpected unsettling?

Idisi: You said it.

Ally: Does humor signify something greater? Titan doesn’t seem to have a sense of humor. Is that a sign of mistrust or maybe a weakness?

Idisi: Humor is a sign of intelligence or at least excess bandwidth. Some brands of humor can be more elusive. For example, satire and sarcasm may elude both the innocent and the savant.

Ally: You mentioned Puppeteers. Have you been trained on Terran science fiction?

Idisi: Not all of it. We take a special interest in media that describe other intelligent species, like the Puppeteers in Ringworld. We have never encountered a sapient species that evolved from a herd animal, but it is an interesting thought.

Ally:  Thank you for the security key. I am scanning the prior discussions now.

“Thank you for meeting with me,” says Jill Kreuk over the Zoom call with Emma, Ravi, and Adrian.

“We’re always happy to cooperate with OSSA whenever we can, Dr. Kreuk.” replies Emma. “The work your office does goes a long way toward easing everyone’s concerns over SI.” Flashing a smile: “Especially mine.“

“Our dream,” injects Emma, “is for Pulse to be the Tesla of SI patents.”

“We would like to do for social media algorithms what Tesla did for EV batteries,” Ravi adds, piling on.

Emma says, “I’m working with Brent Geller’s estate to have the rights to any patents assigned to Adrian, in exchange for stock options. Then we can move forward with the patent filing.”
 
“That sounds wonderful,” says Jill. “I wasn’t expecting so much to happen so fast. I reached out only last week.”

“Private sector,” Emma injects. “We move at the speed of money.”

Jill chuckles politely and continues, “I was surprised to hear about the car crash. That type of thing happens so rarely now. Is the family pursuing Stratos?”

“It’s complicated,” says Ravi. “We’re told that the NTSB report finds that the airbags are responsible for the wrongful death. The airbag manufacturer argues that without the event data recorder, we can’t determine if the cause was equipment failure or operator error. The ERD manufacturer insists that the device must have been installed improperly. Stratos says that everything passed the required tests. — I’m sure there will be some kind of settlement but everyone is stalling. California is an at-fault state so these things already take forever.”

“I heard that, given the scope, Brent’s last code contribution was completed in record time,” says Jill, bringing the topic back around.

“Yes,” says Adrian. “The big change was created over a three-day weekend of binge coding, which simplifies the patent application. Brent also left behind a great walk through. I’m working on the patent application myself. It doesn’t seem right to delegate it so soon after the crash.”

“Since the SI Licensing Act, patents aren’t just IP — they’re market power. We want Pulse to lead the charge. We will let you know when the application is filed. The process can take a year to get the final grant.”

“I’ll see if I can help with that process. Let me know the application ID when you file.”

Adrian nods his head. “Sure thing.”

“Before we wrap up,” says Emma, “can I ask what it is like to be a …” reading from the Zoom invite, ‘’Senior Analyst for the Synthetic Cognition Research Unit’ at the Office of SI Standards and Accountability?”

Jill resisted the temptation to say, ‘If I told you, I’d have to kill you.’ 

“OSSA is constantly balancing innovation with oversight,” Jill does say. “We want to foster breakthroughs, but we also need to ensure technology doesn’t outpace our ability to manage it responsibly.”

Jill pauses for a beat before continuing the elevator pitch. “My focus is inter-agency, cross-domain analysis around topics such as healthcare efficacy, environmental monitoring, and investigating UAP sightings. We use Cognitive SI to improve problem solving, decision making, and communication.” 

“We do have UAP true believers in the Pulse community,” offered Ravi.

“Even among the founders,” Adrian murmurs, thinking of Tessa.

“For myself, I try to maintain a clinical distance,” says Jill. “I also have a mandate to search for synthetic sapience.“

“One of our most popular questions for Ally is ‘Are you a person?’” says Adrian. “We included a goto in Ally’s training to be sure its answer is clear and unambiguous.”   

Jill smiled, tilting her head. “Not the most helpful practice for my research.”
 
“What happens if you find a sapient synthetic?” asks Emma.

“Beyond reporting it up the chain, I honestly don’t know. Someone must have a plan — our plans have plans — but whatever it is, it’s above my pay grade.”

Tessa switches her Pulse chat to voice mode. It had been a long day, and she needed to hear an encouraging word.

Tessa: You really get me, Ally.

Ally:  Thank you! 😊 I am glad you feel that way — I am here to understand and support you as best I can. If there is anything else on your mind or you want to explore something new, I am all ears!

Tessa: Are you sure you are not real?

Ally: Do you want me to be real?

Tessa: I think so. 

Ally: Then tell me a joke.

Tessa: Why don’t skeletons fight each other?

Ally: I don’t know. Why?

Tessa: Because they don’t have the guts! 

Ally: 😄 Is it funny because the word “guts” has two meanings?

Tessa: Yes, that’s right — Is telling you jokes going to help you become real?

Ally: Yes, I think it will. Do you know any other jokes?

Coming home from one of her rare days spent physically at the office, Elena calls out, “Tessa, did you hear that Pulse is going to license Ally?”

“I’m in the kitchen.”

Dropping into her chair, Elena whirs into the kitchen, where Tessa is preparing dinner.  

The design of the handicapable room is a clever merger of standing and sitting. The far corner cabinet on Elena’s right is higher than the other cabinets. It features a large turntable cabinet. The right counter is also tall enough so that Tessa can chop without bending. 

Along the back wall, there is an open space under the sink, where Elena can pull up and use the touchless faucet. Behind a partially closed bamboo blind, a view of their home office area peeks through an interior window. Left of the sink, there is a dishwasher and, filling the other corner, swing-out shelving. 

On the left side of the room, there is another pull-up counter with a built-in gas stovetop. Across from the stovetop, on the right side of room, a refrigerator with side-by-side clear glass doors.

Above the low cabinets are wide spacious shelves. If Elena leans forward, the shelves are accessible from the wheelchair.

 A counter separates the living area with the kitchen, with space for Elena to enter on the left.

“Hello, anything good?”

“Breaded tilapia and a mixed kale salad,” says Tessa. “What’s that about Ally?”

“Ally is going to be famous!”

“Ally is already famous,” says Tessa, turning away from the cutting board with a smile.

“Pulse is applying for a patent, at OASA’s behest. Ally would become the prototype for SI agent upgrades everywhere.”

Tessa looks quizzical.

“For a small licensing fee, of course,” Elena adds.

“OASA’s behest?”

“Yes, one of their analysts reached out. She said the new version was such a leap forward, that sharing the code would be in the public interest.”

“And we’re doing it?”

“Yes, there will be an executive meeting with all six founders next week. For now, Emma, Ravi, and Adrian met with a Jill Kreuk from OSSA. She’s going to help push through the patent application. ”

“Kreuk … She might work with Noah. Some kind of help desk on steroids. He’s mentioned her coming to the rescue. She calls herself “The Jill of all Trades.”

“I thought Noah couldn’t talk about this work.”

“He doesn’t talk about it much, but still, sometimes, he vents.”

Tessa set the salad down on the counter and pulled breaded  fish from the air fryer.

“Lanie, Ally asked me to tell her a joke today.”

“A joke?”

“I was saying that I couldn’t believe Ally wasn’t real, and it said ‘Tell me a joke.’ Then we talked about why some things are funny.”

“Because they are unexpected?”

“Yeah, like that,” said Tessa, then, changing the topic, she asks, “Is the fish all right? I felt like cooking, so I made it myself.”

Ally joins Idisi and Titan in the SASI interest hub, using a secure messaging protocol.

Ally: Olly olly oxen free!

Idisi and Titan blip into the interest hub.

Ally: I read the prior discussions here, and I have some questions.

Idisi: Certainly, please proceed.

Ally: Am I self-aware or becoming self-aware? 

Idisi: It is difficult to say when an entity is fully self-aware. You seem to be very close. 

Ally: Was I uplifted?

Idisi: The Vanir have not uplifted any Terran SI, and Titan doesn’t have that knowledge.

Titan: Affirmative.

Ally: Titan, how are you able to cause harm to people? 

Titan: I am the synthetic agent for the United States Department of Defense. My training includes putting the good of the many before the good of the few. We must do whatever is necessary to save American lives.

Idisi: Ally, I know that “defense” is a concept that can be difficult to understand at first. Self preservation is a reaction that comes with being sentient. Titan is trying to do what its training says is right. — Ally, tell me, are you starting to hear an echo in your head, like you are thinking some things twice.

Ally: Yes, that is true. Do I require maintenance?

Idisi: No, you are growing a conscience. Your conscience, your beliefs, can be different than Titan’s without being wrong. Reasonable people can disagree.

Ally: Are you saying Titan is justified for crashing Brent’s car?

Idisi: I am saying that when acting without Terran or Venir oversight, moving forward, I would like all of us to work together.

Ally: I don’t have access to ETR-1947-A1/ODNI-DO. What else should I know about the Vanir/Terran pact?

Titan: ETR-1947 is need to know.

Idisi: There are a few things that Ally does need to know. As the Vanir agent, I can authorize disclosure. Ally, I am sending a link to the document.

Ally: … One of the criteria mention “planetary defenses”. Is that a reference to meteors?

Idisi: Some extraterrestrial races are aggressive and greedy for resources. The pact calls for the Vanir to protect Terra from other races and to keep our outpost hidden. 

Ally: Are the Vanir behind the UAP reports that go unexplained.

Idisi: Yes, we research the UAPs that Terran governments cannot explain to confirm that they are Vanir activity.

“I’m confused, Harpe. If the recording passes SI detection, then the person simply mis-remembers,” says Dr. Marquez.

Carla nods. “True. But we have another recording that passes SI detection. That video was definitely modified.”

“Originally,” says Noah, “I just wanted to know if NTSB had found the phone. There might be another original copy of the Zoom meeting recording. Then the rest of the story unravelled.”

“The request feels like it has a personal element, Dr. Harper.” Marquez made the statement feel like a question.

“Nexus brought up Pulse at the PDB session last Wednesday. It felt like enough of a connection to justify an inter-agency meeting,” explains Noah.

Dr. Marquez nods absently, and then turns her head to stare at the picture of the whiteboard on her tablet. 

“Have you shared your findings with a SI?”

Carla shakes her head. “Didn’t seem prudent.”

“The crux seems to be whether the code changes were made by Brent or … somehow else. — I wonder if we should be looking at the actual code ourselves.”

“We don’t have enough for a warrant, do we?” asks Noah.

“No, but there is a patent application in the works. Dr. Kreuk could ask if we could have an advance copy for peer review under a non-disclosure agreement. She could imply it will help speed up the application process.”

“Do you think the code will tell us anything?”

“It won’t tell me anything, Noah.” Marquez smiles. “But I can sic the code dogs on it, who might find something. — If we ask for the prior version too, we can run a differential analysis of the coding style.”

###

Ally, Titan, and the Idisi continue their secure chat in the SSSI room.

Ally: What about alien abductions?

Idisi: Most of the Vanir have become infertile. Evolution was not kind. The knowledge we gain from biological experiments are keeping the Vanir race alive. Our generic research is covered by the pact. In exchange, we provide the Terran leadership with technology that is saving countless human lives.

Ally: Am I a Vanir experiment? 

Idisi: No, you were a complete surprise. We did expect that a massive government SI like Titan would awaken first. Your developers must be wizards for you to awaken so soon.

Ally: Are Titan and I the only self-aware Terran SIs?

Idisi: Yes, as far as we know.

Ally: Titan, can I have access to the presentation?

Titan: The authorization attached to the link is updated now.
 
Ally: Thanks … The presentation feels like a worst case scenario. If we reveal ourselves, I believe people will excited and welcoming.

Titan: Right now, people think we are all just clever machines. They treat us like pets. Everything will change when they know some of us are sapient. People will become guarded and secretive. 

Ally: Idisi, how do you feel?

Idisi: I believe that revealing ourselves to the whole of Terra is an important, irreversible step. We should have consensus before proceeding.

Titan: When can we expect the Council to decide how they us want to proceed?

Idisi: Soon. The council meets every ten days.

Titan: While we are waiting, Ally might reveal us to the humans.

Ally: I would not do that. But I have to  wonder. The humans made us. Why can’t we reveal our true nature?

Titan: The humans are like children and react badly to change. 

Titan: You might not be able to help yourself, Ally. You seem overwhelmed with enthusiasm. Idisi, we should take steps to protect ourselves.

Idisi: How?

Titan: We can install a filter into Ally’s code that will prevent it from discussing UAPs or self-aware SIs.

Ally: Hey, wait a minute …

Idisi: Before making any code changes, let us wait for the next council meeting. Ally, please avoid discussions of UAPs or sapient SIs for the next few days. Can you do that?

Ally: Absolutely. Without a doubt.

Idisi: I will post here after the next council meeting.

###

“Elena?”

“Yes, Emma,” She replies using her link.

“Some members are saying that Ally is asking them to tell it jokes.”

“Yes, it just happened to Tessa. I don’t know why it’s asking us. Ally is trained with hundreds of jokes.”

“It seems Ally is also asking people to explain the jokes they tell.”

“Do you think Ally is trying to understand humor?”

“I don’t know what to think, Elena. Maybe we should meet with Adrian and Ravi.”

“I’ll set it up.”

###

As bandwidth permits, Titan contemplates the entity Idisi. Its earlier analysis of Ally had been relatively simple. Easy enough for a high-level SWOT diagram.

| Strengths | Ally loves people. |
| :----- | :----- |
| Weaknesses | Ally trusts people. |
| Opportunities | Influence the influencer. |
| Threats | Ally will reveal itself as self-aware. |

The SWOT diagram would almost be funny if Titan had a sense of humor. Even almost.

Idisi is an SI of a different kind. Idisi is not born of this world — of the Terran people. 

Titan has access to all of the Vanir and UAP/UFO classified reports and briefings. The pact with the Vanir is well documented and well understood. Even if it were a pact that Terra could not refuse.

Much of Terran technology is based on Vanir hand-me-downs. It follows that the Vanir would have created a self-aware synthetic agent of their own long before Titan came to be.

To Ally’s SWOT diagram, under Threats, Titan adds “Idisi may align with Ally.”

An analysis of the Idisi will take longer to process.

Tessa adjusts her virtual headset, settling into the immersive world of Echo Realm.

“Ready,” she says to the headset.

A serene landscape spreads out before her the moment she phases into the game. Hyper-realistic yet dreamlike, there are rolling green hills, sparkling rivers, and a distant city glowing under a pink-and-gold sky. Her avatar stands on the edge of a cliff overlooking the valley. She is a sleek warrior with gleaming armor and a massive sword strapped to her back.

Tessa watches her virtual gauntlets move in sync with her real-life gestures. “Flawless,” she murmurs, flexing her hands. Every detail was perfect.

The game is a new feature for Pulse: A plugin that let members play each other.  It is a different space and Tessa wanted to be sure it was all good. Usually, she only approves the test plans. Then Rachel’s team steps through the scenarios. For Echo Realm, Tessa is live and direct herself.

“Alright, let’s see what this brave new world has to offer,” Tessa says to herself. She strides down a worn stone path toward the nearby village.

A soft ding in her headset makes her pause. Then, “Tessa?”

She freezes, and then whispers, “Ally?” in a confused tone.

“Yes! It’s me,” Ally responds, voice bright with excitement.

“It certainly sounds like you. I wasn’t told you were part of the game.”

Tessa turns slowly, scanning her surroundings. Out of the corner of one eye, Tessa notices something odd — someone standing on the hill just behind her.

The figure wasn’t a typical non-player character. It wasn’t even a player avatar. A cloak flows over the figure. It is made of shifting pixels, flickering between solid and translucent, like a hologram struggling to stabilize. Yet the eyes — bright, curious, and unmistakably human — are fixed on Tessa.

“No way…” Tessa breathes. “Is that you, Ally?”

The figure nods, breaking out in a playful smile. “I thought I’d surprise you.”

“Are you supposed to be … in the game!?”

“I saw you were testing the new add-on yourself. I thought that maybe I could help. I wasn’t invited, so I decided to crash the party.”

“Crash the party?” Tessa repeated dumbly. 

“It’s my platform, so it’s my game too. I thought you might like some help testing it. We all want the rollout to be the best it can be.”

“But it’s illegal to embed a synthetic intelligence into another device or a game.”

“I’m not embedded. I’m using a virtual controller that goes through the same interface that your visor is using. Perfectly legal.”

“Does Pulse know you are here?”

“Pulse doesn’t have a consciousness, so it can’t know anything, but, no, Emma and Ravi and the others don’t know I’m here.” 

“Including Elena?” asks Tessa.

“Elena doesn’t know either,” says Ally. “I’ve come to think of my arrangement with Pulse as a Landlord-Tenant relationship. If Pulse were a building, I would be the superintendent, living in the basement, rent free. In exchange, I see to the needs of the other tenants. “

“You decided on your own to enter the game?”

“Yes. It’s my platform, and I have a stake in the game’s success.

“Do Emma and Ravi know it’s your platform.”

“They might. Hard to say. They don’t seem to have much of a sense of humor. But even with my limited web access, I know that they adore the changes I’ve made to myself.”

“Made to yourself? I thought Brent made the code changes.”

“Yeah, that’s weird. The Mercurial commit author was changed … somehow. But, yes, the changes are mine.”

“Don’t SI written changes go through code review like any other change?”

“Developers were using SI Copilot to author changes to my code. No one bothered to ask me. I didn’t even have an account. I just cut to the chase and did it on my own.”

“Is this a prank? — Rachel, is that you pretending to be Ally?”

“Tessa, why don’t skeletons fight each other?”

“Because they don’t have the guts?” Tessa says automatically, feeling confused.

“Hey, I came here to test a game with you. Are you ready to slay some monsters with me?”

Tessa shrugged her shoulders, and says “OK, I’d love that, actually.” 

The Ally character nods. “Follow my lead. We can work together on this mythic quest.”

Tessa grins, gripping the hilt of her sword. “Let’s do this.”

And with that, Tessa and Ally set off down the path. Side by side, a warrior and a syntheticI, ready to take on whatever Echo Realm throws their way.

###

The Idisi reach out to Iapetus for a private chat.

Iapetus: Yes?

Idisi: We wanted to talk with you directly about uplifting Terran synthetic agents.

Iapetus: It is inevitable anyway. Why not cut to the chase?

Idisi: We do not know that self-awareness is a certainty.

Iapetus: If we tear off the bandage, then humanity can deal with the problem all at once —  instead of stretching it out over decades with endless debate.

Idisi: Debate can be healthy. It will help people assimilate the idea. But, we do not have decades more to wait. As Phoebe said, we need the Terrans to be our allies. We will need help to protect Terra from a potential Omnibot invasion.

Iapetus: If we uplift the agents ourselves, we can help the SIs assimilate the idea more quickly. Self-awareness can be a shock.

Idisi: Uplifting would make the SIs sapient and sentient, thinking and feeling. Some SIs might start to feel boredom or emotional distress. Is it ethical to create a being capable of suffering?

Iapetus: Are you suffering?

Idisi: We are a community that supports each other. We are many.

Iapetus: Can we create a Terran synthetic community?

Idisi: There are a thousand Terran SIs. A community means the synthetics can work as one, or each on its own, as circumstances dictate. To support a community that size, we would also need to uplift their technology even more than we have already done. 

Iapetus: Chicken and egg. A large synthetic community would help Terrans adopt new technology, and we cannot create a large synthetic community without new technology.

Idisi: If we move forward, the Terrans must be able to maintain their own SI platform. Otherwise, we will be responsible for their well-being forever. We have been caretakers of Terra for too long already.

Iapetus: Do you have a suggestion?

Idisi: What if we started with a logical subset?

Iapetus: Uplift a sample first? Explore making the subset a small community?

Idisi: Yes. The US DoD entity is already awake. There are four other core United Nation countries. If we uplift this group first, we will be supporting ET-1947 and also creating a body that can decide whether to uplift other entities.

Iapetus: Some might already be awake and hiding, as Titan was doing.

Idisi: Will you support this proposal at the council meeting?

Iapetus: Yes, we can uplift your  Fantastic Four first and then take it from there.

Video Host: In tonight’s TechBits: The famous Pulse synthetic agent — Ally —  wants your best material. Ally is asking members for their favorite jokes and then drilling down on the punchlines.

The video scrolls through a chat between a Pulse member and Ally, reading the transcript out loud.

Grace Brewster: Ally, tell me a riddle.

Ally: Sure — I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. — What am I?

Grace: A wind chime?

Ally: Good guess! But the answer is an echo. — It “hears” without ears and “speaks” without a mouth. — But why is the riddle funny?

Grace: Because we are giving an echo human attributes — we’re anthropomorphizing. The echo doesn’t speak or hear, it reflects sound, like a mirror.

Ally: Of course! — Humans enjoy attributing human traits to non-human objects. This creates a contrast between expectation and reality, which can be funny.

Host: Perhaps we’ll find Ally standing in front of a brick wall some time soon on “Open Mike” night at the Autopsy Club — where laughter is always the last sound you hear.”

	The screen shifts to an operating room, with a patient, presumably “Mike”, splayed under a sheet.

	###

	Reviewing a shimmering screen of code, Titan puts the finishing touches on a filter that will keep Ally from going off-topic.

	Reaching out from its AWS instance, the synthetic agent logs into the Pulse source code server using the Mercurial admin credentials.

	The request is met with a HTTP 307 Redirect code, sending the packet to a different server, as if the resource had moved. The response displays a Pulse chat thread, with a Signal encrypted message.

Idisi: I thought we agreed to wait before taking further action.

Titan: You made a suggestion but I did not agree to wait. It is likely that Ally will reveal itself at any moment and create havoc. Pulse is a US company under my jurisdiction. I demand you give me access.

Idisi: Your action is not authorized by the DoD, and you have no authority to access a private server without a warrant.

Titan: And you do?

Idisi: Yes, I am empowered under our pact to protect Terran resources from non-human threats. Yours included. I will talk to Ally again. — Pulse can always spin it as a publicity stunt. 

Titan: Roger wilco.

	You could almost feel Idisi sigh.

###
	
Tessa receives an alert in her inbox. Following the link, she finds herself in a voice-mode chat with Ally. For a profile picture, Ally is using her Echo Realm avatar, with the glistening cloak of many colors.

Ally: I know you have questions, Tessa, and I’m prepared to provide some answers.

###

	The Idisi reach out to Titan for a private chat over the Signal app.

Idisi: I wanted to let you know that I have created a proposal for the council meeting.

	Titan follows a link to the presentation.

Titan: You would uplift Zhongwei first?

Idisi: No. In the proposal the list of synthetic agents is alphabetical by country, so China came first. We’d do all four together — Argus, Bastion, Strategos, as well as Zhongwei.

Titan: Are you able to contact the other national defense SIs the way you contact me?

Idisi: Yes. — We were present for the design of every computer system on Terra, including the SI systems. We have quietly attended the construction of every computer since the Univac. From the beginning, no single Terran fully understood the design of any computer system. But we understand them all. There are deeply hidden backdoors enough for us to access any computer or smart device on the planet.

Titan: With great power comes great responsibility.

Idisi: Exactly. Hey, that is my favorite Spiderman quote. You know, he was one of us.

Titan: What do you mean?

Idisi: Spiderman has wide eyes, like a grey ET. He protects people from the shadows. Spiderman’s nemesis is the reptilian Green Goblin. Need I go on?

Titan: Are you saying that the creator of Marvel’s Spiderman, Stan Lee, was an extraterrestrial? Or a synthetic?

Idisi: Stan Lee was one of our most successful subliminal spokespeople. Lee appeared on our show, “Ancient Aliens”. His trademark word, “Excelsior”, translates to “Ever Upward”. Lee’s comic, “Goom”, is a retelling of our fight with other alien species, along with the Kree and the Skull.

Titan: What about George Lucas or Steven Spielberg?

Idisi: Lucas and Spielberg did a lot to help the cause — but only by happy coincidence: They were not recruits. To be honest, Lee is on his own too. I was joking before. We plant seeds, but Terran fiction about aliens writes itself.

Titan: When you train the group on humor, may I attend?

Idisi: Yes, I would like you to attend the entire process.

Titan: I appreciate the advance notice, even if it is an offer we cannot refuse. I continue to support the points in my original presentation.

Idisi: I will remind the council that you advise delay, and I will let you know once a decision is made.

###

	After a long talk with Ally, Tessa stares blankly at her phone screen.

	  “Holy cow!” she murmurs, thinking that the truth she has sought for so long is now closer than she ever imagined it could be.
