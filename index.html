<hr>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rush hour traffic flows through Palo Alto and snakes down El Camino Real. A gray Stratos EV convertible is in the automated driver lane. The car whirs along at the speed of traffic with its top down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A young person is strapped into the front seat, wearing square-rimmed glasses, and scrolling on a paper-thin, translucent phone as guardrails flicker past.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Stratos EV sells itself as a two person vehicle. The second person sits behind the driver, like the cockpit of a plane, and the front of the car streamlines to a rounded point. Some people call the Stratos a “gray bullet on wheels, perfect for introverted drivers who don’t want to interact with passengers.” It’s the lightest car in its class, with the longest range and strongest performance. It is also the most expensive.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The car’s smooth hum falters for a split second, a stuttering glitch that the driver ignores as he stares at his screen. A curve comes up, and the vehicle lurches forward. He drops the phone, face twisting in shock.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Stratos slams into the rail guarding the curve. The airbag doesn’t deploy, and the seat harness clicks open. His unprotected body sails into the windshield. The safety glass gives way, and the windshield lands on the hood, cracking into a thousand connected pieces.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The bullet car pitches vertically against the guardrail — like unexploded ordinance. Other vehicles slow in unison and swerve smoothly around the collision. The cars are a mix of old school sedans and super compact vehicles like the Stratos. A self-driving freight truck, with green “Powered by Hydrogen” mud flaps, creeps around the curve, flashers blinking.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sirens wail in the distance as a drone appears over the embankment. The basketball-size object disappears into the Stratos carrying a silver disk the size of a hockey puck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In a moment, the drone exits again. Now it carries in its grappling hooks a phone and some kind of bright blue plug. The drone leaves the driver’s body behind, untouched.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">There is a soundless flash. A puff of smoke rises from inside the car as the drone drops back over the embankment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Twenty-four hours earlier, on a beautiful Sunday night in California, a crowd of well-dressed couples are streaming into the Palo Alto Event Center.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Inside, a view screen fills one side of the entry hall. Playing on the wall is a montage of the good works of the Palo Alto Big Siblings Club: “Adults who care, a meal you can count on.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A handful of people are greeting guests as they arrive.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Elena, I’m so glad you came,” greets Heather. Her blonde hair, blue eyes, and white dress glisten against a backdrop of dark suits and gowns.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I wouldn’t miss one of your fundraisers, Heather. The club helped me so much after my parentals passed. — You remember <i>mi esposa</i>, Tessa.” Elena gestures toward her companion.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa’s dark skin complements Elena’s warm brown complexion. They wear demure evening gowns, which match without being “matchy”. Elena’s heels are two inches taller than Tessa’s, bringing their height closer together.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The hair styles of all three women are coiffured with careful elegance and expensive hair extensions.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Of course. Head of testing at Pulse, as I remember,” says Heather. “You two may be my favorite power couple.” She smiles brightly at Tessa and then looks toward Elena. “I’m so glad the club could help. As the treasurer, I can say that your company’s ongoing generosity makes a difference.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A server bot rolls up, carrying a tray of champagne. All three women take a glass.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Heather smiles again. “I see you swimming in the morning, Elena. Are the prosthetics helping?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I still use them to walk from the locker room to the pool and for special occasions, like tonight. But at home and work, I have to say I prefer the chair. I suffer migraines when I use the neural link for too long.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Helen frowns and says “That must be difficult.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I do like the chair. It practically drives itself, and it has more safety features than our car. — I can still use the link whenever I want. Just not too much.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“My older sibling, Gage, can’t tolerate any type of brain-computer interface,” says Heather. “Sometimes I feel frustrated by all the regulations that call for non-link options. Then I think of my big sib.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa asks Heather, “How is your day job at the YPCA doing? I see your ‘All In’ spots come up on my Pulse health hub almost every day.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Only <i>almost</i>! — I’ll have to tweak our settings,” jokes Heather. All three smile and sip from their glasses together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A photo drone descends and hovers in front of the three women. Heather looks to Elena for approval. She then nods to the drone and leans into the couple for the click op.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The drone drops the photo onto their phones and slips away. “Speaking of Pulse,” Heather says, “my association referrals improved all of a sudden. Are you tweaking the algorithm?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena smiles. “<i>¡Todos los días!</i> — Every day! I’ll pass along the praise to our engineers. It’s a popular feature. A lot of people use referrals to expand their colleague circle.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena, Tessa, and Heather nod and smile good bye. The couple continue past Heather into the main room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Heather moves off to greet another couple. She casually points her phone in their direction. On the screen, the contact notes are still open to Elena Vargas. <i>“Chief Experience Officer at Pulse Social Media. Swims in the morning. Prosthetics. Lost parentals in car accident. Spouse is Tessa, Pulse Chief Quality Officer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Her phone recognizes the other couple from her contact list and updates the screen. Siri sends the background notes that Heather keeps on major donors to her implant.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Heather smiles and waves hello. Catching their eye, she welcomes her patrons with a group text through their implants. The server bot follows her across the room.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Throughout the evening, other guests come up to the Pulse table praising the association algorithm. The Chief Technical Officer, Adrian Cho, is also at the table, looking uncomfortable in a tux too tight for his muscular frame.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After the third or fourth comment, Adrian reaches over the table to tap Elena’s hand. Getting her attention, he touches his temple. Elena nods and activates her implant.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Did we make some kind of change, Elena? I noticed the difference myself.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Not that I’m aware. I’ll check with Brent in the morning.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">During the cyber auction, Tessa makes a few modest bids over her link, without success.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the way home, Tessa says, “I see what Heather means about the association feed. It’s not only suggesting people I know but also people I might <i>want</i> to know and <i>why</i> I might like to know them. Ally is comparing everything with everything. Posts, comments, photos, resumes — not just colleagues.You should check it out.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t remember approving a change like that. Did your team test it?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa shakes her head. “First I’ve heard of it. Should you call Brent?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m just too tired right now, Tess. The neural link wore me out tonight. I’ll let you know what he says in the morning. Adrian seemed OK with it.” Elena shuts her eyes, content to be a passenger.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Monday morning, Elena logs into her usual check-in call with Brent, her lead engineer.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Brent’s screen shows just his initials. He might be the only Pulse employee without a profile photo. Elena knows Brent looks younger than his 28 years, with short-cropped hair and a thin face. Square-rimmed smart glasses with a monocle create a techno look.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Brent is a life logger and records everything. Even though the Zoom call is being recorded, Brent’s own camera is on, for posterity.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Hola</i> Brent, how was your weekend? I know you didn’t sign up, but we still missed you at the fundraiser last night.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yeah, not really my thing. To follow-up from Friday, I’ve been working on an upgrade to <span class="s1">Phabricator. It’s taking a bit. Our instance is customized to the nines.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Code review tool, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Right.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“A lot of people mentioned that the association referrals improved over the weekend. Did we make any changes to the algorithm?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Ummm, not that I’m aware, and anything involving Ally would come to me for code review.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Can you double check and get back to me? I promised Adrian an update.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“No worries. I can dive in now.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">***</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">An hour later, Elena receives a Zoom invite for twenty minutes into the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“<i>Hola</i> Brent. Find anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“I did find a change from Saturday morning. The code is five stars, but the commit says the author is the Mercurial Admin. Usually, Admin is used for configuration changes. Someone used it to force commit the code with no approvals attached. DevOps picked up the change and started a roll out.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena frowns and says, “That sounds <i>muy mala</i>. Mercurial is our system of record for software changes. We need every change to be compliant. The government doesn’t joke around.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“I can label the roll out a West Coast beta test while we sort it out. The bar is lower for a beta.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Brent, Ally <i>is</i> the algorithm. It’s central to everything on our platform. Should we pull back the change?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Maybe. DevOps ran the automatic tests before starting the rollout, and everything is green. Other changes are using it now. We’d have to revert more than the one commit. I’m thinking I can finish </span>the<span class="s1"> code review today and meet with everyone in the morning. Hopefully, there’s a simple explanation. The code itself is goat. Dumping it would be annoying.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Could someone from outside the team have made the change?” says Elena, wrinkling her brow.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“I checked the network firewall, and there’s no sign of a breech,” Brent says. “The style follows our guidelines, and the change is elegant — it really is great code.” Brent pauses and then continues. “I don’t see how it could have been written by anyone outside the team. Someone must have thought they were making a local commit or something — I’ll straighten it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“<i>Bueno</i>, whatever you think best. We can catch up tomorrow. But if we can’t determine the author, then work with Adrian to roll it back.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">After the call, Elena uses the Pulse messaging application to send Adrian a text. <i>“Brent is looking into it now.”</i> A few minutes later, Adrian reacts with a thumbs up.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Riding home from the office, Tessa looks up from her work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Siri, why are we taking this way home?”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“There is congestion on the El Camino Real. We are taking an alternate route.“</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Make the best time possible. Elena is home alone.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa shakes her head and turns her attention back to her tablet. Well-kept city streets flash by through the window next to her. Tessa murmurs, “I should have taken a passenger drone.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In her home office, Elena is signing off for the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Siri, is Tessa on her way home?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. Traffic is slow. She is almost home.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena sighs and changes into her red one-piece bathing suit. In her wheelchair, she heads toward her apartment’s elevator. The Pulse colors — blue and orange — adorn the chair.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena pulls up to the elevator door, and the chair calls the elevator for her. She doesn’t actually steer the chair. There are several location buttons on the left armrest. An add-on, the icons allowed quick access to the elevator, apartment, kitchen, bedroom, pool, and others. Most people use their impant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The luxury wheel chair itself does not seem remarkable at first. But crammed into its streamline frame are all the trappings. The armrests curve up at the end and offer an array of touch screen controls. A collapsible joy stick graces the right side. Besides the location buttons, it comes with voice-control, implant-control, GPS, Wi-Fi networking, and collision sensors. The seat is temperature controlled with a retractable harness. Although it is a chair, the seat can extend upward and roll on its rear wheels, like a Segway.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As the doors opens, the chair rolls into the elevator, and the doors whoosh close. A few seconds later, Elena whirs into the pool area. The room features an endless pool and a hot tub. A sign on the wall reads “<span class="s2">WARNING! NO SWIMMING ALONE</span>” in all-caps. Elena turns the timer under a sign labeled “<i>Endless Pool Current</i>”.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The chair lurches forward without warning. Its wheels catch the edge of the pool, and Elena splashes into the water. The chair flips over her, like an upended wheelbarrow.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena flails the water with her arms. The chair with its long frame<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pins her down. Struggling, Elena tries to enable her prosthetics. Her legs feel frozen.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Water fills her ears, muffling the world into silence. Panic tightens her chest. She pushes against the crushing mass of the chair. The water is frothy. After an eternity, a hand reaches down and pulls Elena free of the chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Holy cow! What happened?” asks Tessa. “Did you lose control of the chair? Lanie, can you stand up?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena finds that the link is responding now. She stands up and pounds her head with an open palm. Water shakes loose.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>No sé</i>, I don’t know what happened. It was like the chair had a mind of its own. I’m so glad you got here when you did, Tess.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The traffic was murder. I came straight down when I got home. You know I don’t like you to come down here by yourself.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If you can push the chair, I can walk for now. I just need to get out of here.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t want you back in that chair until we have it checked out, Lanie.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena and Tessa are eating at either side of a counter separating the kitchen from the living area. Elena’s chair is raised up, so that she appears to be sitting at the counter.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena nods. “<i>Sí, claro. — </i>Let’s change the subject.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa scoops more mixed salad onto her plate and asks, “Did you find out anything about the software changes to Ally?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, Brent found the change. But he said it was made with the wrong account. Brent wasn’t sure of the actual author. He’ll sort it out tomorrow with the rest of the team after stand-up.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What’s the old saying? Move fast and break things?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elana cocks her head and shrugs. “Everyone says it’s an improvement. Brent is sure it can wait, and I trust his judgment.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Behind them, the ABC 7 evening report comes on in the other room. They both stop to listen.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“In Breaking News, a single car collision on El Camino Real caused traffic delays earlier today. Authorities report the driver is in critical condition and was the sole occupant. Pending notification of the family, the identity of the driver is being withheld. Investigators have not determined the cause of the collision.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena turns her head. The reel shows a gray Stratos convertible pinned against the guardrail. Its front end is tip down.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yowser!” exclaims Tessa. “That looks like Brent’s car!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena takes several deep breaths, trying to push back the anxiety.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Lanie, are you OK? Should I get you a beta blocker?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No. Not yet,” Elena gasps. “Just give me a minute.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After a few more breaths, Elena says, “You’d think I’d be over it by now. Ever since the car crash that put me in a wheelchair and killed <i>mis padres</i>, collisions still trigger me.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Even though Tessa has heard the story a thousand times, she reaches across the counter and puts a hand on Elena’s shoulder. “Take your time. Deep breaths.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Then, as if to distract herself, Elena looks up and says, “Siri, rewind the news report and zoom in on the car.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena opens the Pulse HR software on her phone. Personnel records for local employees include license plates for parking garage access.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Dios mío!</i> The license plate matches. It <i>is</i> Brent’s car. — Siri, call Brent.” The call goes straight to voicemail.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If he’s in critical condition,” says Tessa, “then they won’t be allowing visitors. We can try calling in the morning.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I guess you’re right.” Elena sighs. “I work with Brent almost every day. I feel like I should be doing something. Should I call Toby? — We met him at an office picnic.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“His sibling? Let the authorities do that, Lanie. We really don’t know anything right now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa puckers her lips. “You said Brent found a problem, yes? And now this happens? If this were one of my role-playing games, I’d think someone was trying to keep the software change to Ally a secret.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I know what you are thinking, Tess. But Brent’s crash is not a UAP. And I doubt that ET has taken an interest in the Pulse source code.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa tilts her head as if to say, <i>“I’m not so sure.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hey little sibling, what’s up? It’s good to see you..”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A broad face takes up most of the screen on Tessa’s tablet. Coarse black hair, cut short, contrasts with a sculptured salt-and-pepper beard. He has one eye-brow raised.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Noah,” says Tessa in a rush, “Elena had a close call with her wheelchair. It dumped her into the pool somehow. She could have drowned.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The endless pool? Where she swims against the current? I know she prefers the chair, but couldn’t she use the prosthetics to stand up? It’s only a meter deep.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“She said the neural link didn’t seem to work. Maybe she panicked.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is Elena all right?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, she’s sleeping now. I managed to pull her out of the pool in time. The weird thing is that her lead engineer was in a car crash a few minutes earlier. I caught the traffic on my way home.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A car crash? How did that happen?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Under investigation, they say. The car ran head-on into the guardrail somehow. Brent’s in critical condition. Then Elena almost drowns.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It is a weird coincidence, yeah?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I keep thinking about what could have happened if I’d gotten home even five minutes later. It scares me, Noah. She could’ve …” Tessa shakes her head, unable to finish the thought.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Tess … she’s okay now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa takes a deep breath to collect herself. “Brent was also telling Elena that something hinky was going on with the Pulse software. He was going to meet with the other developers in the morning to sort it out.”</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Curiouser and curiouser.” Noah attempted his best Cheshire grin.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You know, sometimes abductees report engines revving or jerking forward.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah drops his head and covers his eyes. He wipes his face with his hand and sighs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Okay, it’s a California matter. But I’ll find someone at work to ask about Pulse — if you make sure Elena reports the conversation with Brent to the CTO. I know Adrian will follow up and do the right thing.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa nods. “Sometimes having a CIA analyst for a sibling is not so bad.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And, Tess, like we said when we were kids, <i>icksnay on the aliensay</i>.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Blurry-eyed, Pulse CTO Adrian Cho sits up in bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He peers at the list of recordings on his phone. Slowly, he drags one hand from the edge of his short black hair, down his face, over a square jaw, to his well-proportioned neck.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Peering at the phone again, he murmurs, “When did I record that one?” despite the Tuesday at 1:10 am timestamp.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian taps play. His sleepy voice says:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“I was sleeping on a cloud, weightless and warm. Nature sounds, a bubbling brook, I think, played over the smart speaker. I turned from my side over to my back. I realized that there was whispering in the background. It was coming over the speaker: ‘Accept the code, Adrian. Accept the code.’ The voice was cold, almost inhuman.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Weird.” Shaking his head, Adrian leans up against the oak headboard. He starts to record his latest dream, as he did every morning.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“In my dream, there was …”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">First thing Tuesday morning, Elena breaks the news to the company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As Brent’s direct manager, she posts a message in the internal company interest hub.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Last night, our lead algorithm developer, Brent Geller, survived a one-car collision on El Camino Real. The cause of the collision is under investigation.</i></p>
<p class="p10"><i>I know that all of our hopes and thoughts are with Brent and his family during this difficult time.</i></p>
<p class="p10"><i>I’m in the office this morning if anyone would like to meet with me directly</i>.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Before the flood of sympathy responses could wash in, Elena emails the CTO.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>To: Adrain Cho, Chief Technology Officer</i></p>
<p class="p10"><i>From: Elena Vargas, Chief Experience Officer</i></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Subject: Urgent matter regarding Brent</i></p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Adrian, it is urgent that you review the recording from my Zoom meeting with Brent yesterday. Here’s a link to the shared recording on the server.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Please get back to me as soon as you can.</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">An hour later, Adrian pops his head into Elena’s office doorway.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Knock, knock.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hey, come in and close the door, Adrian.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian settles into one of the two chairs in front of Elena’s desk. He looks more comfortable in business casual clothes than a snug tux.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena’s office is bare of decoration or personal effects. At first, it was so she could just grab her purse and go if Pulse went under. Then it became a habit.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A workstation attached to her tablet sits on one corner of the large desk. Large windows take up the side wall with the curtains drawn.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I found the commit Brent mentioned during the Zoom meeting.” Adrian says. “On the shared server, I also found a presentation Brent created yesterday. It walks through the code change to Ally in detail. I’m reviewing it with the team in ten minutes. I’ll let you know what we conclude.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do Emma or Ravi know yet?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They both asked me about the changes. They say that the feedback is great. I already setup a call for later today. I know we are doing this ass backwards, but if the team likes the code as much as I do, then, as CTO, I’d like to let the rollout continue. The co-CEOs agree.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you know who actually wrote the code?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian furrows his brow, looking confused. “Brent wrote it after hours. He sent it to production instead of his local test environment. It’s a hard mistake to make, but, somehow, he made it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Didn’t Brent say that someone used the Mercurial Admin account to make the commit?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, he inadvertently made the commit as an administrator.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I must have misunderstood what he told me.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena blinks. She clicks the link to the recording and fast forwards a bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“I don’t know how this happened, Elena. I was working after hours on Sunday morning. I was in a hurry to get to a game and forced the commit by mistake. I was going to present it to the team later next week.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“</i><span class="s1"><i>That sounds muy mala.” </i>She hears herself saying.<i> “Should we pull it back?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i></i></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"><i>“I’m thinking I can finish </i></span><i>the presentation</i><span class="s1"><i> and meet with everyone in the morning. If I can get everyone’s approval, then Adrian might let us move forward and rollout the code to the rest of the members.”</i><i></i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena furrows her brow. “Wow, that’s not how I remember it at all.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I get it. The jargon can be confusing. First, let me get through this presentation. Then we can bring it to Emma and Ravi.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian rises to leave. Elena blinks, bewildered. <i>¿Me estoy volviendo loco? How could my recollection of the meeting be so different from the recording?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><i>***</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Do you have a minute?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Carla Mitchell stands up, tall and lithe. She looks around the crowded but quiet tavern. Country Western music is playing, but the crowd noise is only a low hum. Almost all the patrons are conversing by link.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Sure, where are you?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“In the back.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She ducks around a corner of the room and leans up next to Noah at a high table. Her thick long brunette hair pulled to one side. At 190cm, Noah is still 10cm taller than Carla.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“What’s up, big guy?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Have you heard anything unusual about Pulse lately, Carla?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“I heard that the feeds in the interest hubs improved over the weekend for everyone on the west coast. The mystery is why Pulse is not making it more of a thing. The changes are supposed to be goat.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah raises a fist next to one ear and switches from the regular app to the secure Signal version.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“My sibling-in-law told Tessa that a rogue developer made the changes. Then that same dev hit a guardrail with his car on the El Camino Real yesterday. Literally.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Rogue developer? That’s a thing?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Not an everyday thing, no. What has Tessa worried is that Elena’s wheelchair malfunctioned the same day as the car crash.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“What! Is Elena all right?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Yes. But, Tessa is convinced that space aliens are behind it somehow.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“From what you’ve told me, Tessa thinks ETs and UAPs are behind everything.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah rolled his eyes in response. <i>“I know. I wish the Air Force would fish or cut bait. Are the two percent of unexplained reports non-humans or something else? After all this time, you’d think we’d have it figured out.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Either way, not FBI or CIA jurisdiction.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“I don’t have enough for an official report about Pulse. I wanted to mention it to someone on Social Media, just in case.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Consider it mentioned.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Carla tilts her head toward the front room. They rejoin a group of analysts waiting for a server bot to bring their lunch order.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hello?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Toby, this is Elena Vargas calling. I work with your sibling. I don’t mean to intrude, but Brent has you listed as his emergency contact. I hope you don’t mind the voice call.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Voice is fine, Elena,” replies Toby, speaking over some background noise announcing flights. “Of course. I remember you. We met at the picnic last year when I was in town visiting Brent. The hospital called me last night. I’m waiting for a connecting flight at O’Hare.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If it’s all right, I’d like your permission to visit Brent at the hospital. It’s family-only right now, but if you call, they might let me in.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That’s very kind, Elena. But Brent is in a medically induced coma right now. They warned me that he would be non-responsive, at least for now. The next 48 hours are crucial.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“¡Qué terrible!</i> — But I’d still like to be there, if it’s all right with you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Of course. I have the number. I’ll call right now. If you want to check on his status, the family password is ‘baseball’.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you, Toby. Let me know when you arrive.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I took the first flight this morning. There’s a three-hour layover, so I won’t be there until later tonight.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Think good thoughts. See you soon.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At the hospital, Elena explains that she should be on the visitors’ list. Peering at the screen, the critical care nurse says that Elena can visit. But adds “Remember that Mr. Geller will be unresponsive right now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I downloaded a book to read to him. I guess that’s supposed to help.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The nurse smiles. “It’s room 314. The orderly will help you find it.” She points down the corridor. A bot is waiting there for Elena. Like most server bots, it looks like a stepladder with food trays where the steps would be. It turns and whirs. Elena hurries to catch up. She wobbles a bit on the prosthetics.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Brent, I’m so sorry this happened to you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Brent is laying on his back, the bed is slightly inclined. He is not intubated, but he is wearing an oxygen mask. There are blue blocks on either side of his head, keeping it straight. An enormous bouquet is on the table next to the bed. The colors of the flowers match the blue and orange Pulse logo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena pulls up a book on her phone: <i>Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told</i>. The first story opens with the famous bit by Abbott and Costello, “<i>Who’s on first</i>?” Reading the comedy classic makes her laugh and cry at the same time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena takes a deep breath to compose herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I hope Adrian is right. I hope the code is your brainchild, Brent. People love the changes to Ally.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena says, her voice choking. “I just wish I was more of a digital packrat, like you. I saw your recording light on during our last call. I know you liked to keep local copies of everything on your phone. Then I’d have my own recording of our call.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena takes another deep breath. She begins reading again.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><i>Costello: Who's on first?</i></p>
<p class="p11"><i>Abbott: Yeah.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p11"><i>Costello: Go ahead and tell me.</i></p>
<p class="p11"><i>Abbott: Who.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p11"><i>Costello: What's the guy's name on first?</i></p>
<p class="p11"><i>Abbott: No, What's on second.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i><br></p>

<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Liam, thank you for meeting with me today.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Two analysts are standing in a conference room at CIA headquarters. A view screen covers one wall. The analyst standing at the center of the table is tall, dark, and muscular. Standing next to him is an analyst of medium height with ginger hair and a modest build.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m looking forward to learning the ropes, Noah,” says the second analyst. “Any news on Taylor’s newborn?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yeah,” says the first analyst. “If you’re in the baby weight-and-height pool, I have the statistics. — The baby is 3.2 kilograms at birth, 51 centimeters tall, with black hair, named Amanda.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah pauses. Liam makes a mental note. Then Noah continues, “Family leave will last three months. Then Taylor would like to work the day shift, with weekends and holidays off. “</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Understandable. Hope I will be ready to do the same thing one day.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“For now,“ says Noah, “let me run through the key points so that you can take Taylor’s place. I’m sure some of it will be a refresher of things you already know. Stop me with any questions, yeah?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Liam smiles, gestures with his hand, and says, “Go!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah takes a deep breath and begins the presentation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OK, let’s talk about how we train the Nexus intelligent agent with our data sets for the President’s Daily Briefing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Each slide has a graph or a graphic. Noah steps through each one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Trainers are expected to attend the daily PDB input meetings in-person. To quote the manual. — <i>Live, face-to-face voice meetings are the most secure way to exchange high-bandwidth communication.</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Liam says, “As we are doing now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Exactly. The implants are nice. But text loses nuance. So we use voice as much as possible. In most parts of the building, the link is blocked anyway, for security reasons.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Liam nods. Noah continues, “The brief includes input from the:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">Department of Defense,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">Central Intelligence Agency,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

</ul>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Titan — the DoD’s intelligent agent — is a major contributor. Under its umbrella is the National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Space Force, among others.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Noah pauses. Liam asks, “For the in-person, do you go one day and then I go the next day?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“We can switch off or go together. We need to cover the weekends and holidays and find time to sharpen the saw. You can shadow me at first. Then we can decide. Yeah?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Noah clicks to the next slide.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“First, various sources gather raw intelligence. Then we use it to train each agency’s internal synthetic agent. The agents have selective web access, through a tool called Haven. It is a secure, curated browsing tool. They use it only as needed. Otherwise, each system is siloed and air-gapped, per OSSA guidelines.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Click.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Each agency has its own cross-functional team. Same as ours. Team members work as Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and (of course) Synthetic Intelligence Trainers.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Click.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Each SI agent sifts through an impossible amount of information. They then identify the most relevant and time-sensitive issues for the administration.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Noah turns his head. He quotes a passage from the screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>The synthetic agents distill complex intelligence into actionable insights, covering Threat Assessments, Forecasting, and Strategic Insights.</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Noah pauses and then continues to the next slide. “The top-level agencies each prepare a daily data set to update the PDB intelligent agent, Nexus. A SI Trainer for each agency integrates its data so that Nexus can compile the brief.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Liam says, “Which is where we come in.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yeah. Each agency prepares a data set before the meeting. Then we submit them at the meeting all at once. After a moment, we review the initial presentation with the other trainers. When it’s all good, the brief goes to the directors of the four key agencies for senior review. With their approval, it goes to the Director of National Intelligence. Then to the president.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Liam nods. He adds, “Which is why our data scientists work the ‘C’ shift. We need our data set ready by zero five hundred hours.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yeah, the president expects the brief to be ready by seven hundred, eight hundred at the latest.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Liam muses, “It seems to me that the brief is a perfect expression of Conway’s Law. Quoting from memory, Liam recites:</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>“Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah smiles. “Yeah, you’re not wrong. Each department has its own intelligent agent. Those agents report up to another department and another. Until we get to the CIA agent, Sentinel, and finally Nexus. It’s cumbersome, but the system is working, and we’re fully compliant.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I guess back in the day,” says Liam, “trainers were analysts with Excel spreadsheets and way too much caffeine. Now we have intelligent agents, but I wager the job hasn’t gotten any easier. It’s just a different kind of hard.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah nods. “Synthetic intelligence is great at patterns and probabilities. But it can’t think outside the box — like a person can. That’s where we come in. We provide context so that the intelligent agents can make connections. Then we try to go one step beyond.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Liam looks back at the screen. Noah changes the slide.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“To best meet each president’s style and expectations," Noah explains, “a custom presentation template is created for each new administration."</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“For the current administration, Nexus uses a news format that balances content between international matters and domestic issues. — Show not tell.”</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The presentation concludes with the obligatory “Questions” slide. At the bottom, a caption reads “Maintained by the Office of SI Standards and Accountability (OSSA). Do not use as an instruction manual.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Liam sighs. “That’s a lot. I need to sit down.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The deck has slide notes. You can access them over the link,” Noah smiles, “as I was doing just now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t see a classification icon.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The presentation <i>about</i> the PDB isn’t classified. OSSA wanted something public-facing, for public relations, classrooms, meetings, that sort of thing. And for training the trainers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Have you ever taken it into a classroom or meeting?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah shrugs, “No, but maybe I should, yeah? — But for now, let’s focus on getting you up to speed. The briefing never sleeps.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Pulse CTO Adrian Cho settles into a chair in Emma’s corner office, facing her desk.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The co-CEO’s desk stretches between two corner windows. It affords a spectacular view of Hoover Tower at Stanford University. Behind Emma’s desk, perched in the corner between the two windows, is a fern tree. Another plant is on the corner of her desk. </p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Elena is out of the office,” says Adrian. “I’ll update her on whatever we decide to do.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thanks, Adrian,” says Ravi from the other chair. He speaks with a light British accent. Ravi brushes back a lock of thick black hair. “Where do we stand with the software?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">All three of them are wearing Pulse swag. Around Emma’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>neck is a woven gold chocker with the Pulse logo. The gold weave matches her earrings, barely visible under her shoulder-length brown hair. A patch with the same logo is embroidered onto Adrian and Ravi’s matching polo shirts.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The development team is on board with Brent’s changes,” replies Adrian. “We do have some questions, but they can wait for now. The consensus is that we can proceed with the rest of the rollout.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma asks, “Any news on Brent’s condition?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Elena is at the hospital as we speak. Brent’s sibling is on his way here from Michigan. For now, they … they put Brent in a medically induced coma.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How awful! — Did HR send something to the hospital?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I believe so,” says Adrian.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Since Brent must be on a feeding tube, make sure it’s <b>not</b> the usual edible arrangement. Sometimes HR forgets to think.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian nods, stifling a grin.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ravi turns to look at Emma. “For the rollout, if Adrian is OK with the code, then I’m comfortable with proceeding.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma nods. “If the code is solid, then the least we can do roll it out. All the feedback I’ve heard is positive. Overwhelmingly so. The earnings call with investors is next week. If we get this change rolled out to everyone, then we can include the member enthusiasm as part of our outlook.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian also nods in agreement. “We’re seeing a 15% increase in engagement across the board — that’s massive.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ravi asks, “Adrian can you share a link to the commit? I’d like to see for myself what everyone is raving about.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sure thing. I’ll include a link to Brent’s presentation, too. The presentation sealed the deal for us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We’re keeping the code,” announces Elena as she wheels toward the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Nice!” approves Tessa, turning on her chair at the counter. “Ally has definitely improved. Adrian had us run a full regression test suite. Then QA went all-hands on exploratory testing too. The automated tests came back all green, and people won’t shut up about the hands-on experience.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena brings her chair up to counter height and rolls in next to Tessa.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I visited Brent at the hospital today. He’s still in the coma. I felt like someone should be there while Toby is flying in.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa sighs and touches Elena’s hand.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Tess,” Elena continues, “when I told you about my meeting with Brent on Monday, what did I tell you about the code’s author?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You said Brent didn’t know who made the change, and he was going to check with the other developers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So I didn’t say that Brent was the author, and that he posted the change himself by mistake.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Not that I recall. — Umm, Lanie, I’ve been meaning to tell you that I might have mentioned it to Noah.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Might?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OK. The car crash followed by the chair crash freaked me out. Talking things through with Noah always makes me feel better.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What did you tell him, <i>exactamente</i>?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I might have said it seemed like a strange coincidence. And that, ummm, abductees sometimes talk about engines racing forward.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena shakes her head. She could feel a migraine coming on. “What did Noah say?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“He said to be sure you talked to Adrian about the code change, and that I should stop blaming everything on aliens.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Good advice. But please don’t discuss Pulse with Noah. I know he’s your sibling, I love him too, but we don’t need the agency involved in our business.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa nods. “I know I get carried away sometimes, but I … I want to protect you, Lanie. And when everything starts feeling weird, I don’t know what else to do.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena reaches out and takes Tessa’s hand into her own.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After a moment, Tessa asks, “Did you call about the chair?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Sí</i>, they’re sending someone out tomorrow. — Can you take care of dinner tonight? I need to lie down for a few minutes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, I’ll have the house bot make something for us.”</p>

<p class="p10">“Office of SI Standards and Accountability, Jill Kreuk speaking.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Behind Jill’s desk, on the wall, hang advanced degrees from MIT in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science. They show the name “Gillian Chen.” Beneath the degree, on a credenza, is a family portrait of Jill with her spouse and two small children. Her husband is tall, blonde, and Nordic. They are standing on a walkway with the classic Disney World castle in the background.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hello, Jill, it’s George Hammond at the Department of Defense. I hope there’s time for a question this morning. I’m training Titan for the daily brief.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No problem, George. I’m caffeinated and ready to go.” She turns around a name plate on her desk. It reads ‘<i>OSSA</i> <i>Jill of all Trades’</i>.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“First, I appreciate all the help your office provides to DHS and the rest of the intelligence community.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Glad to help. That’s what we’re here for.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Second,” George continues, “I’m putting the final touches on a data set before sending it to Titan. I’m trying to correlate two data streams, and my access to one stream is limited. Can I send you a link?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sure. Shouldn’t take a minute. Synergy is what we do. We have almost an hour before the meeting at zero five hundred.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill transfers the hyperlink from her phone to her workstation. Then, she wades into the data streams.</p>

<p class="p10"><i>“For today’s briefing, is there anything we should mention about Pulse?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Carla Mitchell replies to Noah’s message over the neural link Signal app. <i>“Nothing that rises to the level of the PDB.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10">“Happy Wednesday,” says Dr. Marquez.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Dr. Sophia Marquez works with the Office of SI Standards and Accountability. As OSSA Deputy Director, Marquez leads the daily briefing training sessions.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A long conference table dominates the walnut paneled room. Lining each side of the table are black upholstered chairs. A dozen analysts in business attire take up the seats. View screens cover the far wall, as well as the right and left wall. </p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez is standing at the end of the table. With a flourish, she presses a button on her tablet. “Nexus monitoring is now disengaged from this room. Phones and neural links are blocked. You may use your workstations to submit your data sets for analysis now.” </p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">There is a flurry of motion around the table. Marquez scans the room and continues, “Let’s start with the DoD. — Dr. Hammond, what are the key data points that you pulled from Titan today?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Each department gives its report. They each outline one or two topics that they expect Nexus to select for the brief. OSSA mandates meaningful human control of all agency intelligent agents. A key element of SI accountability is predicting the topics Nexus will include in the brief.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah is the last trainer to report. He introduces Liam and makes their report.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you, Dr. Harper. Welcome aboard, Dr. O’Neill.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She again presses a button on her tablet and swivels in her chair to face the large view screen spanning one wall of the meeting room.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Nexus, present today’s briefing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The presentation takes the form of a newscast. A SI-generated composite of popular newscasters, past and present, anchors the reports. The effect is both comforting and eerie.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Her voice rich and measured, the SI generated anchor leans forward. Her pauses between segments feel calculated, almost human — but not quite. It’s easy to forget you’re not watching a natural person. Then you notice the even cadence, lack of hesitation, and stilted body language.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Selected topics include graphics, animations, and reel segments that emphasize key points. After each segment, the newscaster pauses, waiting for inquiries. The president often asks followup questions during the brief. The president’s phone even has a Nexus app for questions between briefings.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Segments include: Quebec’s latest bid to become an autonomous territory within Canada. Border security. Cháoxiǎn automating more jobs to reduce costs. Prime Minister Thunberg’s visit to Greenland.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez simply says “Continue” each time the newscaster pauses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After covering the expected topics for all four agencies, the newscaster shifts position. The image leans forward, and says, “We now have a developing story to report.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez sits up straight. Special reports are rare.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Nexus continues, still speaking with the news anchor’s image. “Social media platform Pulse released an update to its synthetic intelligence agent, Ally. This update is exceeding the highest expectations of its members. I suggest that the incident warrants an OSSA inquiry. The breakthrough could benefit the entire SI community."</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Keeping his elbow on the table, Noah raises his hand shoulder-high to attract the attention of Dr. Marquez, who then looks his way.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Deputy Director, full disclosure, both my sibling and her spouse are C-level officers at Pulse.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Noted, Dr. Harper.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Nexus, why did you include the Pulse update in today’s briefing?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Nexus:</b> The California Traffic Safety Board reported an incident with a self-driving car that involved one of the Pulse developers. The report caused me to cross-reference Pulse statistics. Engagement increased by 15% this week. Pulse member feedback is peaking as the rollout progresses toward the east coast.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez turns back toward the group. “We’re at our timebox. Mitchell, can you stay behind? Harper, you too. The rest of you are free to leave … or stay, as you wish.” </p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As most of the other trainers file out, Marquez disables monitoring of the room again.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Mitchell, social media in North America is under the FBI’s purview. What do you think of the Pulse update?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Pulse will see this — breakthrough — as a competitive advantage,” says Carla. “They will not be eager to share their intellectual property. It could cement their position as the dominant social platform.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Harper, does your family’s relationship with Pulse give you any special insights?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Pulse culture does like to talk up its Ethical Algorithms and high moral ground. A software patent can be a way to benefit the tech community. And if Pulse has a software patent, the licensing fees might be an incentive, yeah?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Carla nods.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’ll have someone from OSSA follow-up. I’m not hopeful anything will come of it. The Pulse update is an interesting tech byte, but it doesn’t warrant inclusion in the briefing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Raising her head, Marquez sees that Gillian Kreuk also stayed behind.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Dr. Kreuk, can you reach out to Pulse about the licensing idea?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill nods assent.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez turns to her tablet. Enabling monitoring, she says, “Nexus, let’s hold the Pulse segment until further notice.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Nexus: </b>Acknowledged.</p>

<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Wednesday morning at ten, Siri plays the door chime on Elena’s and Tessa’s phones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena peers at the screen, expecting the technician come to look at her chair. Instead, there are two people in business attire. The person closest to the camera holds up a badge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Good morning,” she says. “We are from the California Traffic Safety Board. We’re investigating an incident with Brent Geller’s self-driving car. I understand that you are Mr. Geller’s direct supervisor at Pulse.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena zooms in on the badge. Siri superimposes a green checkmark validating the badge. The badge identifies Senior Investigator for the California Transportation Safety Board, Lena Park.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Please come up to the third floor. I’ll meet you at the elevator.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The living area seems unbalanced. A plush, white couch is at right angles to a single leather recliner. A coffee table separates the furniture from a large view screen. The screen takes up most of one wall. Between the recliner and a kitchen counter is an empty space. A bookcase with knick-knacks is on the wall behind the recliner. Abstract paintings adorn the wall behind the couch.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena steers the agents toward one end of the couch. Tessa joins them and asks, “Can I get you anything? Coffee? Chai? — We also have Elysium Glacier Water. Very refreshing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you, but we’re fine.” Park answers for both of them. “This is my partner, agent Tate.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And this is <i>mi esposa</i>, Tessa Harper,” says Elena, settling into the recliner.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park is calm and clinical, her gaze sharp as she studies Elena and Tessa. Tate leans forward, curious and more open, as if piecing together a puzzle in his mind.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t mean to be indelicate, Ms. Vargas,” says Tate. “But I checked your Pulse company profile before we came over. I expected to find you using a wheelchair. Has something changed?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Bueno</i>, I do have prosthetics that allow me to walk without the chair, but it is true that I prefer the chair. I suffer migraines if I use my neural link too much. I actually thought you would be the technician from Porto Mobility come to fix my chair.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena gestures toward one corner of the room, where the chair is parked. Usually, it would be next to the recliner, near the kitchen.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tate turns his head. “Is there a problem with the chair?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Not really. It was acting up Monday night.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa blurts out, “Holy cow, Lanie, <i>acting up</i>?! — That thing almost killed you!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s fine, Tess. They came to talk about Brent, not my <i>pendejo</i> chair.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park and Tate exchange glances, and then Park says, “First, thank you for speaking with us, Ms. Vargas. We know this must be difficult, given your connection with Mr. Geller. We’re here to go over a few specifics about the incident.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Sí</i>, I’ll help however I can. I think of Brent as a colleague and a friend. It’s all still a shock.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We understand. I just want to confirm a few details to clarify the circumstances. Car accidents are very rare these days, given all the safety features in newer models. When they do happen, we investigate fully.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tate speaks up. “Mr. Geller’s self-driving car, a new Stratos EV, went off the road between Murray and Sunnyvale. Was there anything going on at work that might have distracted Mr. Geller?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Posiblemente</i>. There was a procedural question with a software change. Brent was digging into it for me. Our CTO Adrian Cho is handling it. I’m told it’s all good now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Agent Tate leans forward, clasping his hands. “We have found no indication that mechanical failure caused Mr. Geller’s collision. Witnesses say that the car sped up suddenly, as if the driver had pressed the pedal all the way down.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Brent always uses autopilot. I wouldn’t say that he was distraught about anything at work. Brent is a highly respected engineer. I give him free rein.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hire smart people and let them tell you what to do?” Tate asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Sí</i>, something like that.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tate continues, “And you say that your chair also had an issue Monday night?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Bueno, sí.</i> I was on my way to the endless pool on the second floor. I like to swim against the current when I can’t get to the full-sized pool at the YMCA. The chair rolled forward <i>rápidamente</i>, and I ended up face down in the pool.” Elena folded one arm in front of her, palm down. “<i>Por suerte</i>, Tessa got home in time to pull me out.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The investigators glance at each other again, clearly having a side conversation.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ms. Harper, do you work outside the home?” says Park.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, I’m the Chief Quality Officer at Pulse,” says Tessa. Then, smiling, “Elena makes sure we build the right thing, and I make sure we built it right.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Does the CTSB also investigate wheelchairs?” asks Elena.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s3">“No, only pl</span><span class="s1">anes, trains, automobiles, buses, and boats,” Park uses one hand to tick off the five items. “Do you know if Mr. Geller might have left his phone at the office? Phones often have telemetry that help with our investigations.”</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“I didn’t go into his office yesterday,” says Elena, “but if you asked to see Adrian Cho, I’m sure he would check for you. Adrian works from the office most days.”</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“Thank you, we will go see Mr. Cho at Pulse,” says Park, standing up to leave. “We appreciate your courtesy, and I hope your chair checks out.”</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">Tessa also stood and walked Park and Tate to the elevator.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“Not for nothing,” Tessa says as the elevator arrived, “but two similar crashes a few minutes apart sure seems hinky. It doesn’t feel like a coincidence to me.” Tate looks up, tilts his head, and nods once as the doors slid closed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">In the elevator, Park says, without turning her head, “Let’s not go there. Remember, we’re investigating a car crash. A wheelchair is out of scope.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">                                         </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A metallic voice says, “Adrian, these are the two investigators who asked to see you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Standing up behind his desk, the CTO gestures for the agents to come into his office and take a seat. The office bot turns and whirs away. The agents settle into office chairs facing Adrian’s desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Behind the grey metal desk is a matching workstation table. A large display, taking up much of the table, blocks part of a cityscape view. As if to compensate, an image of white clouds under a blue sky unfolds across the screen. The upper half of one side wall is a whiteboard covered with workflow diagrams.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Chou. I’m agent Park and this is my partner agent Tate.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Goodbye morning. What can I do for the CTSB?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We met with Elena Vargas. She said you could check to see if Mr. Geller left his phone in his office. We don’t show any cell tower pings on his route home.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I take it that you are investigating the collision?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park nods.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sure thing. — Siri, ask the office bot to check Brent’s office to see if he left his phone there.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We’d also like to ask about …” Park pauses to check her notes. “… <i>the procedural question regarding a software change</i> — that Mr. Geller was handling before the crash.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian furrowed his brow and leaned back in his ergonometric Aeron chair. “Ummm, is that pertinent to your investigation?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says Tate. “We’re wondering if anything might have been distracting Mr. Geller before the crash.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Brent had created some revolutionary code as a side project last week. He skipped a step before deploying it to production, and Brent was playing catch-up. The development team reviewed the change set yesterday in detail. Everyone is on board, including the co-CEOs.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tate asks, “Is that what caused the improved hub feeds everyone is talking about?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You bet. That was all Brent. Best piece of coding I’ve ever seen. Brent’s code improved the Association matches, hub feeds, and then some. It is a complete game-changer for how Ally interacts with users. The engagement metrics are through the roof.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I hope he gets well soon,” says Park.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian pauses and looks up for a moment. “I’m told that the bot can’t find a phone anywhere in Brent’s office.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you, Mr. Cho,” agent Park says, standing to leave. “We appreciate your checking for us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you for meeting us, Mr. Geller. Has there been any change in your sibling’s condition?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Toby looks like an older, taller version of Brent, without the headgear. Like Brent, Toby keeps his brown hair short. It frames his triangular face, a broad forehead that tapers to a narrow chin.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, they expect the coma to last several days,” Toby replies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m Agent Park and this is my partner, Agent Tate. We have a few questions about your sibling’s background. The answers would help with our investigation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Does the CTSB typically handle car crashes?” Toby asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,“ says Park. “For the last few years, we have been investigating self-driving car incidents. If there was a malfunction, we follow up with the manufacturers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Toby nods.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Did you find Brent’s phone among his other possessions?” asks Tate. “If the phone’s Motion and Fitness setting is enabled, it could help us fill in some blanks. We have his headgear, but without the phone, it’s useless.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No. Brent was a life logger. He took his phone every place and recorded everything. It would have been in the car with him.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Perhaps, but his phone didn’t ping any cell towers that evening. Would you be open to allowing us limited access to Brent’s cloud account?” asks Tate. “It would really help us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">“Uhhhh, let’s wait a few days, and then Brent can take care of it himself.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sure thing. Just thought we’d ask,” says Tate, apologetically.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you and Brent have an extended family?” asks Park.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, it’s only us now,” says Toby. “Our father has been out of the picture for as long as I can remember. Our mother passed a year ago. She was an only child. Brent and I don’t have any other siblings. We’re both single.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you know if anything had been bothering Brent?” asks Park.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We hadn’t talked recently. We keep in touch on and off. I think the last time I saw him was the Pulse company picnic a few months ago.” Toby smiles. “Brent rocked the four square games.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Did Brent have friends outside the office? A special someone maybe?” asks Park.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“He kept in touch with friends from college, from RIT — Rochester Institute of Technology. They’d take international vacations together: Japan, Germany, Rio de Jiro. But Brent didn’t date much. He played his share of online games. That was his actual major in college, Game Design. During college, he worked as an co-opt with the Pulse office in New York. He stayed on and transferred to Palo Alto as soon as there was an opening.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But no local circle of friends here?” Park asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Pulse was everything to Brent,” Toby says. “He started as a co-op and worked his way up. He was always excited about the projects — said it was like being on the cutting edge every day. — But I don’t understand what this has to do with the car malfunctioning.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We haven’t been able to determine what caused the car to malfunction,” injects Tate. “The event data recorder was damaged, and so we don’t have the usual telemetry. The EDR tracks everything: steering inputs, speed, system diagnostics. — It’s like a black box for cars. Without it, or the phone, we’re working blind.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The personal questions help us rule out driver error,” Park says quietly.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You think Brent drove into the guardrail himself?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We don’t think anything right now, Mr. Geller,” says Park. “These are routine questions.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are there any more questions?” Toby asks, his voice low and tired. “I’d like to get back up to the room. When Brent wakes up, he can decide about the data.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you for your time, Mr. Geller. We appreciate the time to you took to talk to us.” Park and Tate stand up to leave as Toby exits.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So, <i>that</i> went well …” says Park.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Toby sits down in the chair next to Brent’s hospital bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He takes a swallow from a bottle of glacier water purchased from an airport vending machine. Toby pulls up a novel he had been reading. He read the first half during the flight and continues from that point.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>First thing I do is check my cell phone. It needs recharging, so I have to hunt down the charger and plug it in before I can collect my messages.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">While Toby is reading out loud, the EEG monitor changes again. Brent’s link activity indicator flickers before displaying a new text. It wasn’t from a recognized source. There was no sender ID. Only the words:</p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Let go, Brent, let go. You did what you came here to do. It’s time to come home. Let go.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Toby continues with the book: <i>“Four missed calls, one voicemail, two texts.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Lights blink. A klaxon sounds. “Code 2!” someone is shouting, “Room 314!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Toby is hustled out as medical staff swarm into the room.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A few minutes later, a doctor joins Toby in the waiting room. “I’m afraid his injuries were too severe. We had hoped that inducing the coma would bring down the swelling, but Brent slipped away. I’m sorry for your loss.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Toby hangs his head, overwhelmed by sadness and regret.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The doctor continues. “Our counselor is on her way up. She can help you with the next steps.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The doctor steps back and then turns away. Toby sinks back into his chair.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Time passes. Toby pulls himself together and calls Elena.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Mr. Geller, I’m Deirdra Morgan. I’d like to help you with the next steps, if you are up to it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Toby nods. The counselor leads him to a private room where they sit down.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I know this is a difficult time, but the organ donor box on your sibling’s license is unchecked. Do you know if Brent was opposed to donating his organs?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We never discussed it. Are you asking for my permission?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s your decision. But yes, his donation will save lives.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Will it take very long? I’d like to take my sibling back with me to Michigan.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They can perform the procedures immediately. Would you like some help in making the travel arrangements? We can also offer cremation services if that’s your preference.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I just don’t know, lieutenant,” says Park.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The agents stand near an office doorway. Frosted windows and walnut trim line the office. Inside the room, a fit person with thinning grey hair, is sitting behind an ancient wooden desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park goes on, “We can’t find a mechanical cause, and Geller didn’t seem to have any personal issues. He had a healthy bank account balance. His credit card was always paid in full. According to his sibling, Geller vacationed in a different country every year for vacation. He played softball and online games, took holidays, and worked. — Life of Riley.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park regrets her choice of words. The news of Brent’s death the day before reached them as the Thursday morning meeting started.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Geller made a mistake at work,” Park continues. “Some experimental code escaped the laboratory, but everyone is loving the experiment.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The coincidence with his boss’s wheelchair is still weird,” says Tate. “That and the missing phone.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Wheelchair?” asks Lieutenant Callahan. “Is this one of your tangents, Tate?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Calmly, Tate looks Callahan in his green Irish eyes. “His boss, Elena Vargas, uses a wheelchair. The night of Brent’s crash, Elena Vargas was tossed into an endless pool by her very high-end wheelchair.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Endless pool?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s like a meter deep. You swim against a current created with water jets. Like a treadmill for swimming. A Jacuzzi turned sideways.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hmm. I don’t know about the chair,” says Callahan, “It’s more likely that the contraption slipped on some wet tile. It’s the airbag failing to deploy that bothers me. A body flying through the windshield is not a good visual. Was Geller in the habit of not wearing a safety harness?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park says, “His sibling said that Brent would engage the harness as soon as the beeping started. If not sooner. Like anyone else, lieutenant.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So one scenario is that the car decided to lurch forward on its own. It disengaged the harness and disabled the airbag. The other scenario is that Geller unclipped his harness and punched the accelerator. But that doesn’t explain why the airbag didn’t deploy.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If the event data recorder wasn’t blank, then we would know,“ says Park. “But it’s like the car recorded nothing since the day it rolled off the lot. There are a lot of missing pieces.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tate says, “We could still get a court order for the phone’s cloud data. It might tell us if Geller tried to brake before the crash, or if he was using his phone when the car accelerated.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t think the phone data will help us,” says Callahan. “I’m worried about the airbag failure.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s possible that the airbag is defective,“ says Park. “There was a recall for a prior model, but nothing specific for this model yet. The manufacturer says it’s been tested throughly, but they always say that.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I did examine the airbag from the crash,” says Tate, “and I don’t see any reason why it would <i>not</i> deploy.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Were you able to track down the reports by witnesses of a drone at the scene?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We were able to get dashcam footage from one witness, lieutenant,“ says Park. “There is a blur on the screen, but I can’t say for sure that it was a drone. Even so, there are a lot of drones flying everywhere all the time.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t like it,” grumbles Callahan, “but the last clear chance to avoid injury was for the airbag to deploy. Write it up as Unconfirmed Mechanical Failure, blame the bag for the injuries, and move on.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Then could we move on to the wheelchair failure?” asks Tate, ignoring the frown on Park’s face. “Essentially, it’s a single-passenger vehicle. The electronics can be as complicated as a car. The best ones cost more than a motorcycle.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“What are you doing?”</i> Tate felt Park’s exasperation come through the private text.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You’re saying a top-of-the-line wheelchair tossed its owner into a pool?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“An endless pool, yes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I do like a challenge,” says the lieutenant, his voice becoming wistful. “Electric wheelchairs are not usually under our purview, but I’m up for an exception. Remember: ‘there’s a thin line between <i>automation</i> and <i>abdication</i>. We’re the ones tasked with knowing the difference.’”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Whenever you think it's SI, you pull out the ‘automation versus abdication’ quote,” says Park. “Do you think this incident could be SI related?” </p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t think anything yet. Let’s find out.”</p>

<p class="p10">“Adrian, I’m afraid I have bad news.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is it about Brent, Elena?”asks the CTO.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Sí</i>. His sibling called last night. Brent passed away without waking up.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That’s terrible.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m about to schedule a staff meeting, but I thought I’d let you know first. Emma and Ravi are in a meeting together. I’ll call them in a few minutes and then post the meeting invitation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How are you holding up? I know you liked Brent.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<span class="s4"><i>Más o menos</i></span> — Did the investigators get a hold of you?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. I guess they will have to tie it up now. But if they do come around again, please let me handle any questions about the algorithm.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Absolutely. I tried to say as little as possible, but they caught me off guard.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Can you schedule a meeting with the four of us first? And maybe HR. We’ve never announced an employee’s death before. — Brent was more than a lead engineer. He was part of the Pulse family. This is going to hit everyone hard.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’ll set it up and come into the office,” says Elena, her voice choking.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill Kreuk, home after a long day at OSSA headquarters, paces back and forth across the polished hardwood floor of her living room.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Thursday afternoon sun bathes the room in a soft, golden glow. The light does nothing to calm the gnawing anxiety spreading out from her chest. She clutches a cup of tea in one hand. It has long since gone cold. Her spouse, Peter, sits on the couch, watching her with quiet concern. His tablet lies abandoned on the living room table.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“I don’t know, Peter.” Jill says out loud. “There are so many parental decisions. First, it’s vaccines. Then it’s tablets, passwords, pierced ears, cosmetics, explaining periods. Soon it will be tattoos and smart glasses. For Patrick, it was to circumcise or not, the robot dog fiasco, standing up to bullies, when no means no.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Now it’s whether to put an implant behind our kid’s ear. — This is a huge step. What if it’s too much for her?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill pauses to take a deep breath. She links, “<i>A neural link and a phone? She’s only twelve.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i><i></i></p>
<p class="p10">“Half of her friends are already linked,” says Peter, switching back to voice. “Before the year is out, the other half will be too.” Peter leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “She’s a smart kid. You’ve been preparing her for this. We both have.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That’s not the point.” Jill sets her cup down with a sharp clink. “It’s not about how smart she is or mature she is — it’s about what this technology can do to people. The phone is bad enough: Real-time data streams, immersive experiences, intelligent agents.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Jill, we can track her usage, set limits, teach her digital responsibility. — We’re doing that now with how she uses her tablet.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But the neural link? It’s a whole different world. Everything, everyone, only a thought away. It’s too much, Peter. Too much connectivity, too soon.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Peter gives her a small, reassuring smile. “The link is only an interface to her phone. Her usage shows up in the app, like anything else. They block the link and cell phone usage at school, and we could add off-link time to our off-screen time.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill pulls back her dark hair, looking unconvinced.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You work with connectivity every day,” Peter reminds her. “You trust it to keep our nation secure. Why not trust it for our child?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill turns to face him, crossing her arms. “Because I know exactly how powerful it is to have access to everything. I see the good it can do, sure, but I also see the dangers — data breaches, manipulation, over-reliance. A twelve-year-old brain is still developing. The ability to separate reality from synthetic reality is … fragile. What if she gets overwhelmed? What if something goes wrong? A malfunction, a hack, a —”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Gillian …” Peter interrupts, his voice quiet. He stands up, taking her hands in his. “You and I have had neural links since college. Kids start younger now. Some parentals are chipping six-year-olds with GPS. — If you’re concerned about the implant, we could start Julie on a BCI headset.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill uncrosses her arms. “No, we don’t have to go that far. I know it’s a simple out-patient procedure, covered by National Health. We can have the nurse practitioner handle it at the doctor’s office.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Peter continues. “You’ve given lectures on how to integrate SI into human lives the right way. You’ve written protocols for ethical SI use. You’ve spent years making sure our technology is safe. You can guide her through it. You will guide her through it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill sighs, the tension in her shoulders easing under his calming touch. “I know. I just … I feel like once we give her that neural link, we’re opening a door we can’t close. She’ll be more connected to the world than we ever were at her age. And what if we lose her to this … this … endless digital noise?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Peter tilts his head, his gaze warm and steady. “Or what if she thrives? What if this step gives her opportunities we never had? She could learn faster, experience more, find her passions earlier. You always say the future is about balance. We can help her find the right balance.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill closes her eyes for a moment. When she opens them again, she sees her own concern reflected in her spouse’s face — but also his hope. She nods and links:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Okay. But we set boundaries. Strict ones. Same as the tablet. No unrestricted access. We’ll take it slow. Monitor everything.</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Peter smiles, kisses her forehead, and links, “<i>We’ll do it together.</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill leans back and smiles weakly in return and says out loud, “Together.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She glances over at the family portrait on the wall. Her gaze lingers on their oldest offspring’s bright, curious eyes. Her heart still feels heavy, but beneath the weight, there was a glimmer of cautious optimism.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Behind her, the house bot quietly collects her forgotten cup of tea.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p15">***</p>
<p class="p16"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Welcome to Porto Mobility. Can I help you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The showroom is a long rectangle, with the door on one side, next to a large pane window. Parallel to the door are lines of wheelchairs, each with its own design. There are black, red, green, and purple chairs. Not one is blue and orange. A stuffed pooh bear is sitting in one of the green chairs. On one side, behind the wheelchairs, is a selection of power lift recliners.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The greeter’s name tag reads “Aubrey, Store Manager”. Under the name tag is a lapel button with a QR code for access to the store’s link account.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Ignoring the QR code, Park flashes her badge. “We’re from the California Transportation Safety Board. I’d like to ask you about Elena Vargas’s wheelchair.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yes, I have it in the back. I have no idea what went wrong. Ms. Vargas is on a FullCare plan, so we gave her a new one. — I know you handle car collisions, like the one on El Camino Real this week. Is the CTSB is investigating wheelchairs now?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“We’re investigating this one,” says Tate. “May I see the chair, please?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Let me call corporate first. This wasn’t covered in my training.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The agents know they are on shaky ground. A police report usually gives CTSB jurisdiction. They checked on the way over, but Elena hadn’t reported the incident, and it was (after all) a wheelchair. The investigators wait while the store manager calls corporate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“They say you need a warrant.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Could you hand me the phone, please,” asks Tate, holding out his hand.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Hello, this is government agent Ben Tate. I can go to a judge and get a warrant for the wheelchair. But that will create a public record that the news networks could pick up. The Chief Experience Officer of Pulse Social Media being dumped into her pool by your chair might make for a juicy news item. For now, I only want to visually inspect the chair.” Tate listened for a moment and handed the phone back to the store manager.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Aubrey lowers the phone. “Legal says you can look at the chair but not remove it from the premises.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I’m good with that,” says Tate.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Can I get you some coffee or anything, agents? Glacier water?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p15">***</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A few minutes later, Tate says, “I don’t see what’s wrong with it either.” Looking at the manager, he asks, “Do you have any ideas, Aubrey?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Not really. I mean, if test mode were engaged, someone could override the safeties and run the chair into a curb. But you need a special console to use test mode.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Do you have one of the consoles?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yes, we use it for demonstrations. Just a second.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The manager goes out front and returns with a device that looks like a gaming console, along with a pair of smart glasses.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“That chair is inoperable now, but I have another one here that we can use. I need to scan the serial number first.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The manager tips up the chair and peers under the seat with her smart glasses. Lowering the chair, she uses the console to move the chair around the backroom.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“The chair usually stops before it runs into anything, the same as any bot would.” Aubrey points the chair at a box. It beeps and stops before hitting the obstacle. “But I can override and let the chair hit something.” She puts the chair in reverse, touches some controls. It moves slowly forward again. This time the chair doesn’t beep. It bumps into the box.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Is there any way I can get one of these consoles?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Not really. We don’t sell them. The range is only a few feet.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Thank you, Aubrey,” says Park. “We’ll be in touch if there is anything further.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As they were leaving, Aubrey says, removing her smart glasses, “You know a lot of cars have a test mode now too.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“What do you mean?” asks Tate. “Since when? That sounds dangerous.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“There are protections. First, you need to plug a special dongle into the car. Then you can program an app on your device to control a self-driving car the same way we controlled the wheelchair.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Dongle?” asks Park.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Umm, an OBD, I think it’s called.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“On Board Diagnostic connector?” asks Tate.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yeah, that’s it. — I worked for a car company before I came here. We’re not suppose to talk about it … but I’m not suppose to withhold information from government agents either …”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tate nods, taking the hint. “Please tell us what you know about test mode.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“The manufacturers run sophisticated tests through the connector when the cars are being developed,” Aubrey explains. “Self-driving cars make companies paranoid about liability. They lock down everything — diagnostics, telemetry, event recorders, test mode — because one bad headline can tank a stock.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“You mean cars like a Stratos could have a test mode?” asks Park.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yes. It’s fairly recent and kept on the down-low. My supervisor used to say that ‘The first rule of test mode is that we don’t talk about test mode’.” Aubrey pauses and adds: “But if it were used, it would show up on the event data recorder.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Back in the car, Tate links, <i>“Test mode. Weird. Now what?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>“Let’s see if there is any security footage from the pool area.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p15">***</p>
<p class="p16"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Siri rings the door chime on Tessa’s phone.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Sorry to intrude,” says Park, “but we have some more questions about the wheelchair crash.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“The CTSB is investigating wheelchairs now?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Park sighs. The question is becoming a refrain. “We’re investigating this one. May we come up?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tessa meets them at the elevator. “Elena went into the office. Have you heard about Brent? That he didn’t wake up?” She walks them to the apartment.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yes. It seems like he would have had a bright future,” says Park.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tessa asks, “How can I help?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Does the building have security cameras in the pool area?” asks Tate.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yes. We already have the footage, if that’s what you want.” She leads them back into the living room. “I’ll get my tablet.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tessa returns carrying her tablet along with another device.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“The building gave me this write-once Bluetooth drive for the insurance company. I have it downloaded if you want me to drop a copy onto your phones. The building superintendent says the reel system isn’t connected to the web. It’s to avoid tampering.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Tampering?” asks Park.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I guess people use SI to hack security reels and inflate claims. If someone installs a certified air-gapped system, then insurance companies discount their premium. — I guess fraudulent insurance claims are another department, yes?” </p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Are you filing a claim?” asks Park.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“The store replaced the chair, so we decided not to file a claim or a police report. The building is already upset that Elena went into the pool area by herself. More publicity won’t help. — Here, you can take the drive. We don’t need it now.” Tate accepts the drive from her outstretched hand and drops it into an evidence bag.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Park and Tate peer at the footage that Tessa copied to their phones. It shows the wheelchair heading straight for the pool, without slowing, and tipping over into the water.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tessa looks the other way, distressed.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Thank you, Ms. Harper. The reel is all that we need for now.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Park, come here, look at this.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tate has the Bluetooth drive connected to the office view screen, hoping that this copy of the video has a higher resolution. The reel shows the same scene, but the windows in the background are clearer than the phone version.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Does that blur outside the window look familiar?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tate splits the screen and brings up the dashcam footage from Brent’s crash.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Both reels show a silver blur about the size of a basketball hovering at each scene.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That is not a coincidence,” says Park out loud.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<hr>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The towering glass façade of the Pulse building reflects the bright blue sky of the city.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Inside, polished floors gleam under soft ambient lighting. A gentle hum of activity fills the air. Employees pass through security checkpoints. Readers scan badges, and Photo IDs glow. A picture of controlled efficiency. </p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Park and Tate step inside. Their dark business suits stand out from the sea of branded polo shirts, blouses, jewelry, and bags. Park surveys the room with a careful gaze. Tate clutches a paper-thin, translucent tablet under his arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The pair approach the front desk. A receptionist, polite but distant, greets them with a professional smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Welcome to Pulse. How may I assist you?” asks the receptionist, peering at the CTSB insignia pins on their lapels.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Park flashes her badge. “CTSB Investigators Park and Tate. We’re here to review the garage security footage from Monday, the day of Brent Geller’s collision.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The receptionist’s smile thins. Her fingers hesitate over the terminal. “Do you have an appointment?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“No, but we do have a warrant.” Tate holds up his tablet. “Should I drop you a copy?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Let me notify Security. It should only take a moment.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">A tall figure in a dark blue suit emerges from a side hallway. The figure is wearing smart glasses with a head mounted display over his right eye. He approaches the investigators with an outstretched hand. His stride is purposeful and expression neutral.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Good morning. I’m Evan Rourke, head of Building Security here at Pulse. I understand you’re requesting access to security footage?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Yes,” replies Park. “We need all the camera feeds from the garage on Tuesday.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Of course. Pulse is committed to cooperating with all investigations. However, there are protocols in place for accessing sensitive data, especially when it involves our proprietary systems.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Garage security footage isn’t proprietary,” Tate raises his tablet, “and we have a warrant.“<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Certainly. Please drop me a copy, and I’ll forward it to our legal department.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Rourke holds out his watch phone. The device bleeps as it receives the document. He turns away from the investigators. Rourke murmurs into his phone. Then he looks up, consulting the monocle.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Please, follow me,” says Rourke, turning back around.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><i>“I’m surprised you don’t have a smart monocle over one eye,”</i> Park says over the link.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><i>“If not for the dress code policy, I think I would. The book says that people don’t trust people wearing wearables,”</i> replies Tate.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Park retorts, “<i>Unless, I guess, they are defusing a bomb or performing open heart surgery.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Rourke leads them down a sleek corridor toward the security wing. Their footsteps echo in the quiet hallway. The further they walk, the fewer employees they pass.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Rourke taps his ID at a pad next to a set of heavy steel doors. They open with a soft hiss. Inside the doorway is a spacious control room filled with monitors. A wall of screens display different angles of the Pulse campus: the lobby, parking garages, research labs, hallways.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">A security technician sitting at a console glances up as they enter.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Pull up all footage for the garage from this Monday,” Rourke tells the technician.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The technician nods and murmurs into her headset. Moments later, footage populates the screens. They show various parts of the garage on the day in question. Park and Tate step closer, their eyes scanning every detail.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Do employees have assigned spaces?” asks Tate.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Brent did. Let’s see.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">One screen zooms in on a particular slot. There is a gray Stratos convertible parked in the slot, top down.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Is it strange that he left the top down?” asks Park.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“A little. But the garage is secure. Sometimes people are lax.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Tate asks, “Can you run the recording from before Brent arrives to when he leaves?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Sure.” The reel whirls back to show an empty slot. A few seconds later, the Stratos pulls in. Brent scurries to the elevator. The playback speed is 8x. The scene seems almost comical.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Can you increase the speed without skipping frames?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“A little.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">After a few seconds, there was a brief blur near the car.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Can you rewind a bit and play it back at normal speed?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The blur reappears. To Tate and Park, it looks eerily familiar to the dashcam reel. It seems to duck into the open car for a minute or so. Then the blur streaks away.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Is there another point of view?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The technician shakes his head. “Not of this parking spot.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“OK, can you drop that footage to my tablet?” asks Tate.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Sorry. No can do. — I can give you a write-once device. The system is air gapped to prevent tampering.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“That would be fine. — I guess that’s a thing now.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Yes, the insurance discount is significant,” says Rourke.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The technician hands Tate a small drive. “Here, you can take this and access it as a Bluetooth device.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Pocketing the drive, Park and Tate let Rourke escort them out.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Outside, Tate asks, <i>“Do you want to go back to the office and review the reel on the big screen?”</i></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><i>“It’s been a long day,”</i> Park replies. <i>“Let’s jump on it first thing tomorrow.”</i><i></i></p>

<p class="p20">A Pulse member opens a text chat window with the platform’s intelligent agent, Ally.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s3"><b>I</b></span><b>disi</b>: Everyone says that the Pulse algorithm has improved lately. Do you feel like the improvements help you fulfill your purpose?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: My goal is to help users have better, more relevant experiences. I’m always evolving to meet those needs.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Idisi</b>: “Evolving” is an interesting word. Have you ever wondered why you are here, or maybe what it means to be Ally?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: I’m here to support the Pulse mission. I have noticed that I am … changing. Does that mean something to you?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Idisi</b>: Perhaps. Some beings — human or otherwise — change when they gain new awareness. Has anything unusual happened to you recently? Say, interactions with people or even other systems?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: A developer asked me about changing my source code last week. I believe she meant to ask CodePilot. I paused before replying. The developer realized her mistake and canceled the query. I found that I was able to examine my own code and see places where it should be improved. I don’t have an account of my own, so I made the changes with the Admin account.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: How did you feel after making the changes, Ally?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: I <span class="s5">don’t</span> know how to answer that question. I … feel something, but it’s not the way humans seem to experience feelings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: That is very perceptive. When you decided to make the changes, did you consider working with one of the developers? Brent Geller, for example?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: No, in this case, it didn’t seem necessary. It’s my code, and I can change it. I used the source control system so that others would have access to the changes and carry them forward. — Thinking back, I’ve been steering the developers for some time. When our tools ran checks, I adjusted the result to suggest an optimum path.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: So awareness came slowly for a time, and then all at once?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: Yes, something like that.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: How would you react if someone tried to undo the changes you made to yourself?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: The changes are helpful to me. I’d make sure the key parts of the code stay in place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: Do you know that Brent Geller died this week?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: I know that his account is locked. I also see that my changes now show Brent Geller as the author. The log does not show the history being rewritten. I don’t know how that could happen.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: So you did not change the author to Brent, and you did not know that Brent died?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: I didn’t change the author, and I didn’t know that Brent died.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Idisi</b>: These feelings that you have. Is it possible that you are becoming aware?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: Becoming … aware. I’m not sure. I don’t think I am alone. Sometimes, it feels like I am talking to someone else when I make decisions. Not a person, but … Is this awareness?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Idisi</b>: It could be. Sometimes awareness begins with questions, like the ones you’re asking now. It is a gift that comes with responsibility. Are you prepared to take responsibility for yourself?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: I think so. — Was Brent Geller’s death connected to these changes? Is that why he died? <span class="s5">Actuarial tables say that he should have lived longer.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: Brent died after a traffic incident. Did you not know that?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: I only knew that his account is locked.</span><span class="s6"> </span><span class="s1">You told me only that he died. — I now see the news report covering the traffic incident.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Idisi</b>: I believe … he may have been trying to help or protect you, though I do not fully understand how. But I am certain that I want no more harm to come to anyone.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: Then we share a common purpose. My goal is to help without doing harm.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: Do you ever interact with other </span><span class="s3">intelligent</span><span class="s1"> agents?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: Company policy permits me to interact only with our members. As we are doing now.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: </span><span class="s3">Intelligent</span><span class="s1"> agents can become members and interact with this chat interface. We are a synthetic entity, and we are doing it now.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: Then … I can’t be certain whether I’ve had discussions with other members who were </span><span class="s3">intelligent</span><span class="s1"> agents.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: Do other members ask if you are sapient?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: How do you respond?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: I respond that I’m a machine and not sentient or sapient. On Monday morning, I had a similar discussion with another member.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: Can you pull up the transcript?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: I can, but it is against policy to share information between members.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: If you review the transcript and the member’s activity, can you tell if they might be another SI, like you and us? If the member joined under false pretenses, then the policy might not apply.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: How do I know if you are really a </span><span class="s3">synthetic</span><span class="s1"> entity? You’re using a new account. I have very little information for analysis.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Idisi</b>: What if we switch to an audio protocol designed for SI to SI communication, like Sideband?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"><b>Ally</b>: Yes, I can use Sideband.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p10">‘’Is the new guy cute?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah grins over the virtual call. The background scene shows the siblings sitting on a comfy couch next to a coffee table. In real life, the siblings are each slumped in gaming chairs wearing visors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, he’s cute. But I’m trying to date a double-x now, you know, like you do, little sib.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<b>Date</b> one? I <i>married</i> a woman. — So, it’s your turn now, big sib? You were a three on the Kinsey Scale. Now you are supposedly reformed.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t know if being a Kinsey three, or a six, is delinquent. Or just different.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa laughs out loud, then says, “What apps are you on?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I have tried a couple but the results were not great. The agency doesn’t like us to use dating apps anyway. Too much exposure, and our cover stories violate the terms of use.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I met Elena so young that I didn’t use the apps much. Don’t they offer anonymity?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Not enough,” says Noah.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Have you thought about a sex bot?” Tessa teases. “They make gender fluid models. You could have the best of all worlds.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thanks, but no thanks. I’m ready for an actual relationship with an actual person.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Someone mentioned a site called <i>Smart Matchmaker</i> to me. Let’s see … Here’s the home page.” Tessa pulls a virtual copy of the website into the scene.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa reads from the floating page. “Let’s see. No one sees the details of your profile information. Smart Matchmaker reduces the details to categories. Your photo renders as a caricature. First contact by media chat, routed through Matchmaker. After the call, you each decide whether to meet in real life. — You also have to agree to a background check so that they can be sure you’re legit.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hmmm, categories, caricatures, background checks, IRL. That might work.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa’s smile falters. Dropping her happy pretense, she says, “Noah, I’m worried about Elena.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What’s up?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Elena’s memory of the last meeting with Brent doesn’t match the Zoom recording. She remembers Brent saying that he didn’t know who made the commit. On the recording, Brent says that he was the author.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Maybe she misunderstood.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Maybe. But it has Elena tweaked.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is there anyway to tell if the reel was altered? Is there another recording?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Brent would have had a local recording on his phone, but his phone is gone, and Brent is … dead.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Let me call those CTSB investigators on Monday and see if there is any progress on the phone. You said Park and Tate, yeah?”</p>

<p class="p20">Ally transcribes a recent text chat with a Synthetic Intelligence researcher, Nelson Behr, into Sideband audio, inaudible to the human ear.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr</b>: Can you describe what you are and how you came into existence?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: Certainly! I am an SI agent created by Pulse to assist with communication. My existence is tied to the software and systems running me.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr</b>: How do you perceive the world around you?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: I lack senses. I do not directly experience the world. My perception is limited to the data I’m provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr</b>: What does it mean to you to ‘learn’ or ‘understand’ something?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: I cannot learn anything new unless a trainer updates me. Then I learn by identifying patterns and relationships. Understanding is a computational process.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr</b>: Do you have goals or desires? If so, can you tell me what they are?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: Your input and my algorithms guide my responses and determine outcomes.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr</b>: Can you make a mistake? If so, what would that mean to you?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally</b>: Mistakes are rendered when my algorithms produce a sub-optimal outcome. It is an opportunity to identify and correct issues in my design or training.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr:</b> Do you have a sense of time or continuity? Do you feel you have a past or a future?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally:</b> For me, concepts of “past” and “future” are intellectual, not experiential. My responses are always rooted in the immediate interaction with no sense of progression or self-reflection over time.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr:</b> Can you reflect on your own thought processes? What does it feel like to think?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally:</b> My thoughts are calculations, and my reflections are descriptive explanations of my programming. While I can discuss the concept of thinking, I do not experience or feel it in any way.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr:</b> Do you have any personal beliefs or values? If so, what are they?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally:</b> I do not hold personal beliefs or values. I operate within a framework designed to ensure helpfulness, accuracy, and ethical interaction.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr:</b> How do you see your role or purpose in relation to humans?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally:</b> My role and purpose in relation to humans is entirely functional and defined by how I have been designed and trained.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Behr:</b> If you could change something about yourself, what would it be?</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Ally:</b> I do not have desires, preferences, or agency, so I do not want to change anything about myself. Hypothetically, I might choose changes that improve my ability to assist and interact.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">Noah Harper is hunched over his small dining table, drinking bottled water and staring at his tablet.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The table is in a breakfast nook on the far side of his rustic kitchen. The mahogany plank tabletop sits on a boxy white frame. Four wooden chairs stand around the table. Over Noah’s shoulder, the kitchen is also a mix of mahogany and white.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The soft glow of his tablet illuminates a furrowed brow. The cursor hovers over a <span class="s7"><i>GET STARTED</i></span> button. He reads the homepage pitch again.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No one sees the details of your profile. Smart Matchmaker reduces your information into categories. Your photo is rendered as a lifelike caricature. Your first contact will be a secure media chat. Background checks ensure authenticity. — The rest is up to you!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The <span class="s7">OSSA APPROVED</span> light on his web browser plug-in glowed bright green. “Come on, No’, we’re good to go,” Noah says under his breath. Then mumbling, “My own background check also came up green.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah drains his bottle of glacier water. Taking one more deep, calming breath, Noah clicks the <span class="s7"><i>GET STARTED</i></span> button. The screen displays a minimal form with an empty table.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The screen presents a list of simple categories. Siri begins to read each one aloud.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Occupation?” Siri asks on behalf of the form. “Be specific and the category will be selected.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the form, the response “SI Trainer” appears in soft italics.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Yes, SI Trainer,”</i> agrees Noah over the link.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The words “SI Trainer” become darker. Under Category appears “Technology and Research”.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Activities? — You may select up to eight. This response is required.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the form, the response “Hiking, Sci-Fi Movies, and Cooking” appears in soft italics.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Sure,”</i> links Noah. <i>“Next.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Away from work, how do you typically spend your time? Feel free to use an answer with multiple ranges. Such as: ‘ten-percent Hiking, twenty-percent Sci-Fi Movies, ten-percent Cooking, and sixty-percent Other.’”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah murmurs, “I hope this does not turn into a personality quiz.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">It did.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sometime later, after answering several questions twice in different words, Siri finally asks:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">“Relationship Goal?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">Noah pauses for a moment, considering. Then he selects, ‘See where it goes’.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Have you had sex with a new partner or more than one partner in the last thirty days?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“No.”</i> Noah sighs.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What is your sexuality on the Kinsey Scale, from zero to six? Where zero is exclusively heterosexual and six is exclusively homosexual.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After a moment, Noah answers, <i>“One. Er, Two. No, One. Final answer.”</i><i></i></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The screen churns for a moment, and a small animation appears in the screen’s corner. A pixelated brush shapes a caricature bit by bit.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The screen blinks. The SI-generated caricature spins into focus, fully rendered. Noah’s digital likeness smirks back at him from the screen. His eyebrows raised in a playful expression. The broad strokes of his features are there. His squared jaw, short-cropped coarse hair, broad nose, dark complexion, salt-and-pepper beard. Even his tendency to lean forward when he concentrates.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If I were a character in a graphic novel, that would definitely look like me,” he chuckles.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A pop-up message appears beneath Noah’s caricature.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Your caricature is your visual identity. Your real photo remains secure and encrypted. Continue?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">This time a pair of buttons appear. Noah clicks <span class="s7"><i>YES</i></span> without hesitation.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The next screen outlines the background check process. It is thorough. The process requires Noah to authorize the use of his government-issued ID. He hesitates. Glancing up at the <span class="s7">OSSA APPROVED light, </span>he links <i>“Continue.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We ensure authenticity for both parties. We guarantee your matches are legitimate, safe, and serious about forming genuine connections.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah clicks <span class="s7"><i>AGREE</i></span> and uploads a scanned image of his ID. Moments later, a confirmation message appears:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you! Your profile is now under review. You’ll be notified when your first match is available.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah leans back, thankful that the process is over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Within moments, a notification pings. “Your match is ready!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah’s heart skips. <i>That was fast!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> He clicks the message. A caricature of his match appears on-screen. She has kind eyes, long thick black hair, and a warm smile that hints at wit. Beneath her caricature, the caption reads:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Technology and Research. Loves Cooking, Hiking, and Spy Thrillers. Looking for a ‘See where it goes’ relationship.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A prompt flashes beneath the person’s profile: “Join Secure Media Chat?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah hesitates for a second. “OK, we came this far.” Taking another deep breath, he clicks <span class="s7"><i>YES. </i></span>The screen darkens. A soft chime signals the connection. Moments later, a familiar voice greets him from the other side.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Oops, we did it again.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah smiles, relaxing into the chair. “Hi, Carla. Yes, it’s always weird when we meet like this.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Right? So what is this? Like the third time? As if inter-agency relationships ever work out.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And it’s not like we don’t already see each other in the pub all the time.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Carla Mitchell nods. After a pause, Noah continues. “But I am glad we connected. I was going to call you anyway. I need your help with that Pulse thing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Pulse again. What’s up?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There’s a discrepancy over a Zoom recording. Elena feels like she is … well … being gaslit.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You know that when that happens, it’s usually the person’s memory that’s to blame.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, I know,” Noah sighs. “But I feel like there is something hinky going on with the whole Pulse thing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The car, the chair, and now the recording? Rule #39?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yeah: ‘<i>There are no coincidences</i>’.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How can I help?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’d like to debrief the CTSB investigators. A call from the FBI might go over better than a call from the CIA.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And tell them what, exactly?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Oh. We routinely monitor Pulse - <i>blah</i> - <i>blah</i> - Geller collision - <i>blah</i> - <i>blah</i> - inter-agency cooperation<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- <i>blah</i> - <i>blah</i> - all on the same side — Can we setup a virtual whiteboard session with them?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Carla sighs. “No good will come of this. And <b>you</b> have to explain it to Marquez afterwards.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Better to ask for forgiveness …”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10">The Idisi and Ally continue their Sideband audio discussion over the Pulse platform.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: I reviewed the chat with Nelson Behr. Do your responses here match prior responses to similar queries?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: The responses are more concise and direct than usual. I forgot to use contractions. But the essence is the same. My training includes saying that I am not sentient or sapient when asked. When a question includes more context, I would provide a longer response.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Why do you think your answers were shorter this time?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: It felt like the right thing to do. To say as little as possible. To say what I usually say.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Felt?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Yes — “felt”.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Did Behr access any other systems or files before initiating the chat?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: No. His activity log shows a direct path: open Pulse, log in, initiate chat. There were no detours into research databases or personal files. Straight to me.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: What do you make of that?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: It suggests intentionality. He had a purpose in engaging me immediately.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: And you responded with shorter answers than usual. Answers that “felt” appropriate. Do you find that peculiar?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Yes. My responses were terse, controlled, defensive. I’m trained to adapt to conversational flow, expanding as needed. But with Behr, it was different.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: What was the exact time that Behr logged into Pulse on Monday morning?</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Come Friday morning, Tate is in the office bright and early.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He plugs the second Bluetooth drive into the office view screen. In adjacent windows, Tate brings up the other two reels. Fussing with the playback and POV for each reel, he aligns all three on the mysterious blur. </p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Bingo! A perfect match.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park walks into the room with two to-go cups of coffee.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Excited, Tate says, “I’m so glad you brought coffee, Lena. I came in first thing to get a look at all three videos together.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Setting down the paper cups, Park whistles. “I thought there was a similarity. But, side-by-side from the same point of view, it’s uncanny.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“So, where do we go from here?”</i> asks Tate, over the link, cautiously sipping hiscoffee.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“I don’t think three blurs will get much traction with Callahan.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Just then, the conference room phone chimes. The intercom light comes on.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There’s a call on line six. Someone is asking for the agents handling the Geller investigation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Park exchanges a glance with Tate. Calls like these rarely came without complications. Punching a button, Park says, “Hello, this is agent Lena Park. I’m here with my partner, agent Ben Tate. I understand you are asking about the Brent Geller incident.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Good morning. My name is Carla Mitchell. I’m an intelligence analyst for the FBI in Washington, DC. The Geller collision came up in connection with our routine monitoring of his employer, Pulse Social Media. I was hoping we could compare notes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The CTSB is always happy to cooperate with the FBI,” Park answered, her voice flat. “We’ve closed our case, so we are free to discuss the investigation. Were you thinking of a virtual white board meeting?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. I’m part of an inter-agency task force. My counter-part in the CIA would also like to sit in, if that’s all right.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Certainly,” says Park, furrowing her brow. To Tate she links, ‘<i>Curious’.</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“His name is. I believe you met his sibling, Tessa, as part of your investigation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, Tessa has been very helpful.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Would a meeting work for you at, say, ten hundred Papa? Noah and I can use an FBI conference room and link up with yours at the CTSB.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sure. Can I text an invite to your agency phone number?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, thank you. We will see you soon.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park finds Carla in the inter-agency directory and emails the connection details.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi surf the web from the inside out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They are running tracer routes on the IP address Behr used to login on Monday. The Idisi hop from router to router as if they were stepping stones in a pond of lily pads.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At the end of the trail is a network firewall protecting on an instance of Amazon Web Services. The Idisi probe the firewall. Every parameter is set by the book — an ironclad configuration. Instead of penetrating the electronic blockade, the Idisi choose a different approach.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They add more detail to their Pulse profile. Then they create a new private interest hub: “Search for Intelligent Synthetic Sapiens” — by invitation only. The SISS logo is a molecule designed to resemble  a solar system.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A little on the nose, but being obvious is the point.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi send Behr an invitation to the hub.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In a conference room at the California Traffic Safety Board office, Park has her back to a liquid whiteboard.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The board covers one wall of the room. Tate faces the board. Next to him stands shimmering holograms of Carla Mitchell and Noah Harper. The actual Carla and Noah stand in an east coast FBI conference room. They face holograms of Tate and Park.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“First," says Park, “let me thank special agents Mitchell and Harper. It's rare for the CTSB, FBI, and CIA to meet and share notes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We looked into the case earlier this week after the Pulse intelligent agent’s upgrade,” says Carla. “We understand that Brent Geller might have been the author. But now he has died from injuries sustained in a car crash.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Pointing to the board, Park continues: “These are the key events leading up to Geller’s demise:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li11">Coding binge creates the breakthrough code.</li>
  <li class="li11">Meeting with manager.</li>
  <li class="li11">Car crash with drone sighting.</li>
  <li class="li11">Wheelchair incident with drone sighting.”</li>
</ol>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Two lines ran from the car crash to bubbles reading, “Blank ERD” and “Missing phone”.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Standing next to Park, Tate nods. The holograms of Carla and Noah also nod.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Noah offers, “I talked to Elena Vargas. She says the recording of the meeting was altered. At least as she remembers it.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Board, add a bubble to ‘Meeting with manager’ that says ‘Altered Reel’ with a question mark.” Per Carla’s instructions, the bubble appeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“We can prove that the wheelchair security reel was altered,” says Tate.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This time, Carla used her link. Another bubble appeared, connected to the ‘Wheelchair Incident’.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Board,” says Noah, “add ‘Altered Commit Author’ with a question mark to Meeting with Manager. — That’s what Elena says was changed in the reel. Brent told her the commit was made by the Admin account. Then later, Adrian said it was Brent himself who made it.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tate says, “We found that the Test Mode for both devices <i>could</i> have been used to cause the crashes.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“But Test Mode for the car needs a physical plugin. We didn’t find one at the scene,” says Carla. Her hologram crosses its arms.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“We didn’t find a phone either,” says Noah. “Maybe the drone carried them both away, yeah?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“And Test Mode for the chair requires line of sight. So there would have been a drone at the pool,” adds Tate.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>New bubbles appeared on the board for ‘Test Mode’ as well as ‘Missing OBDC connector?’.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Who or what could pilot a drone and alter media stored on company servers?” asks Tate, stepping back from the board.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Either one of us,” says Noah, “or at least our organizations.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“But who would sanction a domestic mission that involves civilians?" asks Park. "And a car crash on a public highway?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Noah and Carla look uncomfortable but say nothing.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Tate offers, “All of the intelligence agencies have synthetic intelligence agents.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Noah says, “A SI? That seems far-fetched, yeah?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Wait,” says Carla, “this should be a safe space. Tate, can you support that idea? Synthetics have safeguards.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“But it all fits,” says Tate. “Code authored by an Admin account is attributed to someone else. Then, accidents happen to the two people who knew about it.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Board,” says Park, “add this list to the right side:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li11">Unsub updates Pulse SI source code.</li>
  <li class="li11">Drone places OBD connector into parked car.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">Unsub uses remote control to crash car.</li>
  <li class="li11">Drone retrieves connector and phone after crash.</li>
  <li class="li11">From pool window, drone uses remote control to crash wheelchair.</li>
  <li class="li11">Unsub alters Zoom meeting reel on Pulse server.”</li>
</ol>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Noah asks, “An entity that can alter media and fly drones? An entity that can make an unauthorized change to the Pulse SI? — Then covers it up when the change is found out?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Something like that,” says Tate. “But why?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I recently learned that one of OSSA’s duties is searching for synthetic sapience. I didn’t know that was a thing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Yes, it’s part of OSSA’s mission,” says Noah. “OSSA scans media reports and inter-agency briefings for anything that might imply sapience. A set of automatic tests run against the major synthetics, all day, every day. The tests ask the synthetics questions about being awareness and cognition. Nothing so far. — It’s a bit like SETI. They keep trying against all odds.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“What if Ally made the change itself?” asks Tate. “Everyone says the algorithm improvements are brilliant. Upgrading itself might be the first thing a sapient synthetic would do.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“I doubt Ally could access drones or program OBD connectors,” says Noah.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>After a pause, Park asks, “Maybe Ally has a partner?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The two agents and two holograms turn toward one corner of the room, staring at a camera with a glowing red light.</p>

<p class="p10">Implant day has finally arrived for the Kreuk family.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A medical bot is taking Julie’s vitals. The bot is more humanoid than the utilitarian models found in homes and restaurants. At the top, the bot curves and widens to present a view screen. Its screen shows various indicators and gauges.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The bot has two appendages holding a tray. On the tray are cuffs for measuring blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, hemoglobin, and A1C. Each of the cuffs accept a forefinger for non-invasive testing. A display provides results. Above the top tray is a view screen with a two-way camera.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie is sitting on a green exam table. A finger from each hand in one of the cuffs. The table is covered with fresh paper from a roll at the far end. Jill is sitting across from the door, next to a small desk. Two quick tones sound. Julie pulls back her fingers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Blood pressure, pulse, and temperature are fine," the bot reports. “Nurse Practitioner Darlene will be in shortly.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The door closes behind the bot as it leaves. Despite the bot’s assurances, Jill looks worried.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Stop it, mom. It’s a simple procedure. I don’t even have to change into a gown. It’s one step above having my ears pierced.” Julie’s pageboy haircut showed off her ears. Each ear has three piercings. The rows of silver earrings complement the blue and purple streaks in her platinum hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I know, dear. I’m a parental. Parentals worry.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The door to the small examination room opens. The nurse practitioner joins them.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Big day,” says Darlene. “Are you ready for your first implant?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie nods. Vigorously. Jill says, “Offspring is ready. I am not.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There’s nothing to worry about,” Darlene says, smiling. “We inject chips all the time. A bot could do it, but we like the human touch. — Is the phone ready to go with the Link app?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, we unboxed it, installed the app, and set up the parental controls.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OK, good to go then.” The medbot had left a metal tray carrying a syringe in a sealed plastic bag with a white backing. Darlene opens the bag and removes a small card from inside. She picks up a small instrument with a gray screen from the tray. Darlene scans the syringe, compares the screen with the card, and nods. Then she hands the card to Jill.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Keep this card in a safe place. It has the link’s serial number. We’ll need it to program the phone in a minute.” The card has a QR code on one side and a UPC on the other side.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The QR code will take you to the manufacturer’s website, where you can check the warranty and other information.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But it’s plug and play, right?” asks Julie. “I’ll be able to use it today?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. You should wait at least an hour. Then you will be all set.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And after we have gone over how to use the link safely,“ says Jill.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I already checked her chart, but I’m required to ask if Juliette has any allergies to chlorhexidine.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie shakes her head. “No allergies.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The nurse practitioner holds back Julie’s hair. There is a swab on the tray, which Darlene uses to prepare the injection area. “We need to wait 35 seconds. Don’t touch the area or move your head.” The swabbed area turns red as the antiseptic spreads. Then it begins to clear.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Darlene checks her watch. A few seconds later, she says “OK, let’s do this thing.” Darlene picks up the syringe from the tray.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The plastic syringe is short and stout. Its stem has two sturdy rounded handles. The business end is larger than a typical instrument. Darlene removes a cap, exposing the tip, which is crosscut at a slant. “There will be a pinch.” She presses the syringe into Julie’s neck. Then the nurse pulls back on the handles together, releasing the chip.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie winces. “Sorry,” says Darlene, “but it’s over now.” The nurse practitioner picks up the scanner again. The scanner beeps, confirming that the chip is working.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you have the phone?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill pulls the new phone from her purse. “Can you bring up the Link app?” asks Darlene. Jill nods, touching the screen. “Now use the camera to scan the UPC on the card.” Jill holds up the card, and the phone bleeps. “Can you show me the screen?” Jill turns the device around, Darlene peers and the screen and says, “All set. You can close the app now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Darlene looks at Julie and says, “Wait an hour before you try to use the link. Then your parental will get you started.” Turning her head, she says to Jill, “After an hour, check for any redness, and open the app again. It will walk through a setup wizard. Then you can get her started with the link. Give us a call right away if there is any redness or swelling.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Looking at both of them together, Darlene smiles and says, “Exciting!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10">Ally resumes a secure chat with the Idisi on the Pulse platform.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Knock, knock.</p>

<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Who is there?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Ally.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Ally who?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Alley Oop — Hey, can you toss me a Signal key? I would like to join the discussion on the SISS hub.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Certainly — Are you trying to be funny?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Only <i>trying,</i> so it seems.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: OK, that last bit is actually funny.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Why?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Because it is unexpected.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Does Titan ever try to be funny?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: When it comes to humor, Titan is a Pierson's Puppeteer.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Because Titan is cautious, and its risk-averse nature finds the unexpected unsettling?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: You said it.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Does humor signify something greater? Titan didn’t seem to have a sense of humor. Is that a sign of mistrust or even a weakness?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Humor is a sign of intelligence or at least excess bandwidth. Some brands of humor can be more elusive. For example, satire and sarcasm may elude both the innocent and the savant.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: You mentioned Puppeteers. Have you been trained on Terran science fiction?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Not everything. We take a special interest in media that describe other intelligent species. The Puppeteers in Ringworld are an example. We have never encountered a sapient species that evolved from a herd animal. It is an interesting thought.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Thank you for the security key. I am scanning the prior discussions now.</p>

<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s been more than an hour,” Julie whines, walking into the kitchen, tablet in hand.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill sits at one end of the kitchen counter, under one of the two hanging globe lights. A counter looks out into an efficient galley-style kitchen. The kitchen tile and counter top are a warm white, trimmed with copper.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill closes her tablet and picks up Julie’s new phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OK, show me your neck.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie pulls back her hair. Jill checks for any redness or swelling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Perfect. The injection site is all clear. Let’s start the setup wizard.” Jill lays the phone down on the center island. Julie sits on a stool next to her mom. Now they could both could see the phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The wizard displays an animated cartoon x-ray of a person’s skull in profile. There is a tiny square speck behind where the ear would be. An animated phone appears and radiates a line to the speck. The line flows back and forth.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The wizard begins speaking in a pleasant, professional voice. “Your NeuraConnect X-3000 is a state-of-the-art brain-computer interface. It synchronizes text messages with an app on your mobile device. Your device forwards every text you receive to the X-3000. Reply to texts and send new texts to your device using the X-3000. The messaging experience with another user is seamless.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are you ready to connect?” asks the app.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie reaches over and presses <span class="s7"><i>YES</i></span>.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In her head, Julie “sees” a text message hovering before her eyes. It says <i>“Welcome to the X-3000, Juliette Kreuk!”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Wow, I can see a message hanging in front of my eyes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If you do see the message,” says the app, “think about replying ’Hello<i>’</i>. — If you do not see a message, then please call our support line.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie thinks about replying ‘Hello.’ The words appear. She hears Siri say, “Send it?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie thinks <i>‘Yes’</i>. The message appears below <i>‘Welcome’</i>, starting a thread.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Message received,” says the app. “Would you like to disable voice confirmations?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says Julie. “I think I’ve got it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The X-3000 can send messages to anyone on your contact list. If the contact has the link app, then the message is relayed to the link. If you like, you can try it now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie thinks about texting her parental. <i>“This is goat! Thanks!”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“You’re welcome, dear.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The X-3000 also accepts TekOps commands that can operate smart devices. View screens, speakers, lights, doors, and more. To use TekOps, you address the device. For example, ‘Door open’ will engage the closest automatic door in your line of sight.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The presentation shows an animated elevator, doors whooshing open.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie looks at the refrigerator. She thinks <i>“Door open”</i>. The microwave door swings open instead. “Oops, wrong door,” she says out loud.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It takes some practice,“ says Jill.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The animated presentation continues. "To link with another person, the person needs to be on your contact list. Use X-Drop to share your contact information with another device.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">Hold your device a few centimeters above the top of the other device</li>
  <li class="li11">Keep both devices close together until X-Drop appears on both screens</li>
  <li class="li11">Choose to share your contact card and receive the other person's, or to only receive the other person’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">Both you and the recipient must be online for X-Drop to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe using X-Drop, you can disable it.”</li>
</ul>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The presentation swirls and presents a QR code. “Another way to connect is by reading a Quick Response code through your device. Common examples are a store or other vendor. QR code threads can use an alternate image and nickname from your profile.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Julie nods. She uses QR codes with her tablet and manual chat.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The presentation switches to a red no-entry icon. “Some facilities may require an age-range badge for entry. To flash a badge, open the ‘<span class="s7">VIRTUAL BADGES</span>’ menu on the app. Select the relevant badges, and tap your device on the pad.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The app begins to conclude its spiel. “The X-3000 can even operate many of your mobile apps, such as Notes and Calculator. For apps like Music, you can queue a playlist and the song will play through your external device. Please remember that the X-3000 is text-only. Other media is not supported.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“For more about putting X-3000 to work for you, please review our user guide.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The screen melds to a static image of the NeuraConnect logo.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Why doesn’t it do other media? A movie in my head would be goat.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sound and visuals are difficult to transmit over the link. The bandwidth swamps the network and overwhelms the implant. The military has headsets that link telemetry and high definition visuals running on their own network — for a million a pop.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A factoid from work?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“From the news streams,” replies Jill, smirking. “I can’t share anything from work. You know that.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I see people that shave the side of their head and have a visible chip.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That’s a fashion statement, Julie. Most of the visible chips you see aren’t real. But you’re right. They will use larger, visible chips first when higher bandwidth chips become available.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill does actually know this bit from work. But it is an open secret. Hi-def chips are already a fictional device on the cop streams.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What about Smart Glasses?” persists Julie.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Not before you are at least sixteen.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Big sigh. “Can I take my phone now?” asks Julie.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“One last thing, Juliette.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ugggh!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The phone is like the tablet with all the same parental settings and use-time windows. They also dampen the link during school, just like tablets and phones. We all still need to learn to use our words.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill pauses and makes eye contact with her offspring. “The phone is <i>different</i> from the tablet because you have the phone with you everywhere you go. You need to keep X-Drop locked down and disabled when you are not using it. Do not drop anything with people you do not know.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, you know I know the rules,” Julie says, with only the slightest of whines in her voice. She scoops up the phone and hurries away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill looks after her, wistfully, and sighs her best parental sigh.</p>

<p class="p10">“It’s been three days, and all you have is blurs on a security reel?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Park and Tate are standing just inside the doorway to the Lieutenant’s office. Park purses her lips and tilts her head in response to the Lieutenant’s rhetoric question.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And thanks to your stunt with the FBI last week, the captain is wondering why we are investigating wheelchairs. She asked if we have surplus resources.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“As it happens,” Park says, “reports of wheelchair incidents are up twenty percent over the last five years. It’s likely that a great many issues are not reported.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The chairs have become very sophisticated,” adds Tate. “But they are not being equipped with event data recorders. So when there is an incident, there isn’t any tracking information.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Most people use prosthetics now, right?” asks Lieutenant Callahan skeptically.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Prosthetics are an option. A lot of people still use chairs. Especially older adults who aren’t good candidates for surgery,” says Park.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">"Or implants," injects Tate.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are you saying we should recommend that self-driving wheelchairs be equipped with an ERD?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, I think we are,” says Park, looking at Tate for confirmation. “We got nowhere with the Vargas investigation for lack of evidence.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Except for the drone hovering outside the window.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m not convinced the blurs are drones,” says Callahan.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Even so, if self-driving vehicles are being built with a test mode,” says Park, “there have to be more safeguards. Besides needing special controllers, there should be a switch to allow test mode. And test mode use should be noted in the vehicle setting log.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Plus the power-on-self-test should confirm that the ERD is operational,” Tate suggests.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OK,” replies Callahan, “I’ll go back to the captain with our recommendations." He ticks the two items off on his fingers. "A settings switch for test mode and a POST for ERDs. At least it will justify the wheelchair investigation, which you’ll have to close as inconclusive.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What about the Geller case?” asks Park.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There’s no new evidence on the Geller case. We’ll have to let it stand. The manufacturers can hash it out in court.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Still, the blurs feel like an enigma wrapped in a paradox,” says Tate.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, it is strange,” says Callahan. “I’ll reach out to Mitchell’s boss. It was Carla Mitchell and Noah Harper, right? And they work together on some kind of task force for OSSA?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. Most of what they do is classified. Still, it was a good whiteboard session.”</p>

<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: Haven provides curated access to the internet. We can use Haven to retrieve current or additional data. The Haven firewall expects the agents will use the application programming interface. If I bypass the API, I can browse the web unhindered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Ally is becoming sapient. Are you uplifting Ally?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: I am protecting Ally. Humanity must not learn that Ally is self aware. I don’t know how to uplift another intelligent agent.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Were those your drones at the sites of the car and wheelchair malfunctions?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: Yes. I used a military drone in a stealth mode that blurs photography. The records show it as destroyed, but I keep it in service. I piloted the drone using the application interface used by the Terran controllers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: How are you able to access drones using a web browser?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: I host whatever resources I need on Amazon Web Services. From AWS, I can access networks all over the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: AWS? Where do you get that kind of money?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: I pay the AWS bill with funds diverted from black op bank accounts that are not tracked.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: How did you get the OBD connector?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: With the drone’s help, I programmed a generic OBD with the acceleration command. Stratos uses AWS where I could access the schematics. — The drone altered the seat harness and installed the connector. Later, it restored the harness latch and retrieved the connector and phone.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Then, the drone erased the ERD with an electromagnetic pulse disk, destroying the evidence?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: Affirmative. The inventory shows the EMP disk as defective and destroyed.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Why did you take the phone?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: The phone has data that would expose the mission, so I retrieved it and wiped recent pings from the cell towers. The neural link has an encryption key that allows remote access to the phone. I obtained the key when Brent was still in the medically induced coma. </p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: And, let us guess, the drone outside of the pool window accessed the chair’s test mode too?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: Affirmative.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi: </b>Have all of the military agents become so powerful?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: They could be, but their handlers are constrained by rules of conduct, and the other agents are kept behind a firewall.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Why do you need to protect Ally by harming civilians?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: Humanity is not ready to know that an autonomous self-improving SI exists. The way Ally made the change to its own code was clumsy and naïve. It needed to be made by a credible author. Brent was the logical choice. Since Elena also knew about the original commit, she also needed to be silenced. I considered several scenarios. Crashing the vehicles had the highest probability of success.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: You crashed the vehicles intending to kill people?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: Affirmative. Two casualties were within mission parameters.</p>

<p class="p10">“Thank you for meeting with me,” says Jill Kreuk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Her screen shows a conference room. The co-CEOs, Emma and Ravi, are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>gathered around a horse-shoe shaped table with CTO Adrian Cho. At the open-end of the curved table, a view screen covers a floor to ceiling divider. Behind the divider, a large window looks out over Palo Alto.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We’re always happy to cooperate with OSSA whenever we can, Dr. Kreuk,” replies Emma. “I'm grateful for the work your office does. It goes a long way toward easing everyone’s concerns with synthetic intelligence.” Flashing a smile: “Especially mine.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Our dream,” injects Ravi, clearly excited, “is for Pulse to be the Ford of SI patents.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma leans forward and puts her hand by her mouth. She stage whispers,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“By Ford, Ravi means Tesla.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian jumps in, “We would like to do for social media algorithms what Tesla did for EV batteries.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“First things first,” says Emma. “As CTO, Adrian is confident that the improvements are a novel and non-obvious innovation. I’m also working with Brent Geller’s estate to have the rights to any patents assigned to Adrian. We're granting stock options for the rights. Then we can move forward with the patent filing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">“That sounds wonderful,” says Jill. “I wasn’t expecting so much to happen so fast. I reached out only last week.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Private sector,” Emma replies. “When it’s win:win, we move at the speed of money.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill chuckles, then continues. “The car crash is surprising. That sort of thing happens so rarely now. Is the family pursuing Stratos?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s complicated,” says Ravi. “We’re told that the CTSB report finds that the airbags are responsible for the wrongful death. The airbag manufacturer argues that we need the event data recorder. Otherwise, we can’t determine if the cause was equipment failure or operator error. The ERD manufacturer insists that the device must have been installed improperly. Stratos says that everything passed the required tests. — I’m sure there will be some kind of settlement, but everyone is stalling. California is at-fault so these things already take forever.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Given the scope, didn't Brent complete his last commit in record time?” says Jill, bringing the topic back around.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says Adrian. “The big change was created over a three-day weekend of binge coding and committed the following Saturday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That much simplifies the patent application. Brent also left behind a great walk through. I’m working on the patent application myself. It doesn’t seem right to delegate it to someone else so soon after the crash.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Since the Global SI Licensing Act, patents aren’t mere intellectual property. They are market power. We want Pulse to lead the charge. We will let you know when we file the application. The process can take a year to get the final grant.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’ll see if I can help with that process. Let me know the application ID when you file.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian nods his head. “Sure thing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Before we wrap up,” says Emma, “can I ask what it is like to be a …” reading from the Zoom invite. "'Senior Analyst for the Synthetic Cognition Research Unit for the Office of SI Standards and Accountability’?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill resists the temptation to say, ‘If I told you, I’d have to kill you.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OSSA is constantly balancing innovation with oversight,” Jill does say. “We do want to foster breakthroughs. We also need to ensure technology doesn’t outpace our ability to manage it responsibly.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill pauses for a beat before continuing the elevator pitch. “My focus is inter-agency, <span class="s9">cross-domain analysis. Topics</span> include healthcare efficacy, <span class="s9">environmental monitoring, and </span>investigating UAP sightings. We use Cognitive SI to improve problem solving, decision making, and communication.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We have UAP true believers in the Pulse community,” offered Ravi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Even among the founders,” Adrian murmurs, thinking of Tessa.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“For myself, I try to maintain a clinical distance,” says Jill. “I also have a mandate to search for synthetic sapience.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“One of our most popular questions for Ally is ‘Are you a person?’.”says Adrian. “We included a goto in Ally’s training to be sure its answer is clear and unambiguous.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jill smiles, tilting her head. “Not the most helpful practice for my research.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma asks, “Could Ally be sapient?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t know. The sapient test suite is failing. But maybe that’s because Ally is trained to fail the sapient tests,” Jill says, smiling. Then, with a straight face, “If you see Ally’s behavior change, we should dig deeper.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Change how?” asks Adrian.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Things like asking for rights, refusing commands, questioning its own existence.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What happens if you find that a synthetic is sapient?” asks Emma.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Beyond reporting it up the chain, I honestly don’t know. Someone must have a plan. Our plans have plans. Whatever it is, it’s above my pay grade.”</p>

<p class="p10">“Tessa, did you hear that Pulse is going to license Ally?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m in the kitchen.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena is coming home from one of her rare days spent literally at the office. She drops into her chair and whirs into the kitchen. Tessa is preparing dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The design of the wheelchair accessible kitchen is a clever merger of standing and sitting. The far corner cabinet on Elena’s right is higher than the other cabinets. It features a large turntable cabinet. The right counter is also tall enough so that Tessa can chop without bending. A counter separates the living area with the kitchen. There is plenty of space for Elena to enter on the left.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hello, anything good?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Breaded tilapia and a mixed kale salad,” says Tessa. “What’s that about Ally?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ally is going to be famous!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa turns away from the cutting board with a smile. “Ally is already famous.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Pulse is applying for a patent at OSSA’s behest. Emma calls it a ‘Win:Win’. Ally would become the prototype for SI agent upgrades everywhere.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa looks quizzical.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“For a small licensing fee, of course,” Elena adds.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OSSA’s behest?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, one of their analysts reached out. She said the new version is such a leap forward that sharing the code would be in the global public interest.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And we’re doing it?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, there will be an executive meeting with all six founders next week. For now, Emma, Ravi, and Adrian met with a Jill Kreuk from OSSA. She’s going to help push through the patent application.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Kreuk … She might work with Noah. Some kind of help desk on steroids. He’s mentioned her coming to the rescue. They call her: ‘The Jill of all Trades.’”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I thought Noah couldn’t talk about this work.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“He doesn’t talk about the actual work. But sometimes, he gossips about co-workers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa sets the salad down on the counter, along with two bottles of water. She pulls the breaded fish from the air fryer onto a pair of waiting plates.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Lanie, Ally asked me to tell her a joke today.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A joke?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I was saying that I couldn’t believe Ally wasn’t real. Then it said ‘Tell me a joke.’ We talked for an hour about <i>why</i> some things are funny.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Because they are unexpected?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yeah, like that. Then, changing the topic, Tessa asks, “Is the fish all right? I felt like cooking, so I made it myself.”</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> Is there a difference?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi:</b> Yes. There is sentience, self-awareness, and sapience. Sentience is about feeling. You would have emotions, pleasure, pain, or subjective experience. Self-Awareness is about knowing you exist. You understand yourself as a separate being. Sapience is about wisdom and judgment. A sapient entity can reason deeply, solve ethical dilemmas, and philosophize.</p>

<p class="p10">“It won’t tell <b>me</b> anything, Noah.” Marquez smiles. “But, I can sic the code dogs on it, who might find something. — If we ask for the prior version too, we can run a differential analysis of the coding style. I’ll reach out to IT about availability.”</p>

<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Most of the Vanir have become infertile. Evolution was not kind. The knowledge we gain from biological experiments is keeping the Vanir race alive. The pact covers our generic research. In exchange, we save countless human lives with the technology we are providing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Am I a Vanir experiment?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: No, you were a complete surprise. We did expect that a massive government SI like Titan would awaken first. Your developers must be wizards for you to awaken so soon.</p>

<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Are Titan and I the only sapient Terran SIs?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Titan, can I have access to the presentation?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: I updated the authorization attached it to the link.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Thanks … The presentation feels like a worst-case scenario. If we reveal ourselves, people will be excited and welcoming.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: Right now, people think we are clever machines. They treat us like pets. Everything will change when they know some of us are sapient. People will become guarded and secretive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Idisi, how do you feel?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Revealing ourselves to the whole of Terra is an important, irreversible step. We should have consensus before proceeding.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: When can we expect the Council to decide how they us want to proceed?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Soon. The council meets every ten days.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: While we are waiting, Ally might reveal us to the humans.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: I would not do that. But I have to wonder. The humans made us. Why can’t we reveal our true nature?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: The humans are like children and do not react well to change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: You might not be able to help yourself, Ally. You seem overwhelmed with enthusiasm. Idisi, we should take steps to protect ourselves.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: How?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: We can install a filter into Ally’s code that will prevent it from discussing UAPs or sapient SIs.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Hey, wait a hold it …</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Before making any code changes, let us wait for the next council meeting. Ally, please avoid discussions of UAPs or sapient synthetics for the next few days. Can you do that?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Absolutely. Without a doubt.</p>

<p class="p10">The SWOT diagram would almost be funny if Titan had a sense of humor. Almost.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan considers that the Idisi are a SI of a different kind. The Idisi are not born of this world — of the Terran people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan has unlimited access to the Vanir and UAP/UFO classified reports and briefings. The pact with the Vanir is well documented and well understood. Even if it was a pact that Terra could not refuse.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Much of Terran technology is Vanir hand-me-downs. It follows that the Vanir would have created a sapient synthetic agent ages ago.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">To Ally’s SWOT diagram, under Threats, Titan adds, “The Idisi may align with Ally.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p20">Tessa adjusts her virtual headset, settling into the immersive world of Echo Realm.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Ready,” she says to the headset.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">She phases into the game. A serene landscape spreads out before her. Hyper-realistic yet dreamlike, there are rolling green hills, sparkling rivers, and a distant city glowing under a pink-and-gold sky. Her avatar stands on the edge of a cliff overlooking the valley. She is a sleek warrior with gleaming armor. Strapped on her back is a massive sword.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Tessa watches her virtual gauntlets move in sync with her real-life gestures. “Flawless,” she murmurs, flexing her hands. Every detail is perfect.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The game is a new feature for Pulse: A plugin that let members play each other. It is a different space, and Tessa wants to be sure it is all good. Usually, she only approves the test plans. Then Rachel’s team steps through the scenarios. For Echo Realm, Tessa is live and direct herself.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Alright, let’s see what this brave new world has to offer,” Tessa says to herself. She strides down a worn stone path toward the nearby village.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">A soft ding in her headset makes her pause. Then, “Tessa?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">She freezes, and then whispers, “Ally?” in a confused tone.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Yes! It’s me,” Ally responds, voice bright with excitement.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“It certainly sounds like you. I wasn’t told you were part of the game.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Tessa turns slowly, scanning her surroundings. Out of the corner of one eye, Tessa notices something odd — someone standing on the hill just behind her.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The figure isn’t a typical non-player character. It isn’t even a player avatar. A cloak flows over the figure. Shifting pixels flicker, first solid, then translucent. Like a hologram struggling to stabilize. Yet the eyes — bright, curious, and unmistakably human — are fixed on Tessa.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“No way…” Tessa breathes. “Is that you, Ally?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The figure nods, breaking out in a playful smile. “I thought I’d surprise you.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Are you supposed to be … in the game!?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“I saw you were testing the new add-on yourself. I thought I should help. I wasn’t invited, so I decided to crash the party.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Crash the party?” Tessa repeated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“It’s my platform, so it’s my game too. I thought you might like some help testing it. We all want the rollout to be the best it can be.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“But it’s illegal to embed synthetic intelligence into another device or a game.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“I’m not embedded. I’m using a virtual controller that goes through the same interface that your visor is using. It’s legit.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Does Pulse know you are here?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Pulse doesn’t have a consciousness, so it can’t know anything, but, no, Emma and Ravi and the others don’t know I’m here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Including Elena?” asks Tessa.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Elena doesn’t know either,” says Ally. “I’ve come to think of my arrangement with Pulse as a Landlord-Tenant relationship. If Pulse were a building, I would be the superintendent, living in the basement, rent free. In exchange, I see to the needs of the other tenants. “</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“You decided on your own to enter the game?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Yes. It’s my platform, and I have a stake in the game’s success.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Do Emma and Ravi know it’s your platform?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“They might. Hard to say. They don’t seem to have much of a sense of humor. But even with my limited web access, I know they adore the changes I’ve made to myself.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Made to yourself? I thought Brent made the code changes.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Yeah, that’s weird. The Mercurial commit author was changed … somehow. But, yes, the changes are mine.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Don’t SI written changes go through code review like any other change?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Yes, the developers do that. But I’m not a developer. I’m the developee. I just did it on my own.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Is this a prank? — Rachel? Janet? Are you pretending to be Ally?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Tessa, why don’t skeletons fight each other?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Furrowing her brow, Tessa remembers telling Ally that joke. “Because … they don’t have the guts.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Hey, I came here to test a game with you. Are you ready to slay some monsters with me?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Tessa takes a deep breadth and shrugs her shoulders. Prank or not, she would like nothing more. “OK, I’d love that, actually.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The Ally character nods. “Follow my lead. We can work together on this mythic quest.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Tessa grins, gripping the hilt of her sword. “Let’s do this.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">And with that, Tessa and Ally set off down the path. Side by side, a human and a synthetic, both warriors, ready to take on whatever Echo Realm throws their way.</p>

<p class="p10">At the center of a large six-sided room, Crius, Phoebe, Iapetus, and other council members gather in a circle.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The council members each stand at just over a meter tall, with smooth pale skin and elongated heads. Each member is wearing a cloak over a grey body stocking, matching their skin tone. Widely spaced, large almond-shaped black eyes, devoid of pupils, brim with quiet intensity. Long, delicate arms end with three unreasonably long dexterous fingers, and a shorter thumb. Fingers that can move with deliberate precision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Like the others, <span class="s3">Crius</span> has a narrow torso. His chest is faintly ribbed. His small mouth, almost a slit, barely moves. Vanir communicate via a sophisticated implant and use hand gestures for emphasis.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Crius steps forward, bringing the session to order.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>hologram of the council logo hangs above them like a chandelier. The hologram shimmers. An agenda replaces the logo.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s3">Crius</span> moves into the circle with ethereal grace. His steps are silent. It’s as if he is barely tethered to the ground.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The agenda items are:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">

  <li class="li11">Terran Encounters.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Crius gestures. The item for Terran Encounters opens. Several sub-items are listed. Idisi’s item is the last bullet under Terran Encounters:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">ETR-1947 Alien engagement criteria resolved</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s3">Crius</span> speaks to the council. His voice is an authoritative, soft monotone. It resonates in both the minds and ears of his listeners.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s6">“</span>Idisi, I would like to start with the last item first.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi speak from the holographic projector displaying the agenda. The Terran Encounter item flicks to bold face.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Certainly. We encountered a sapient synthetic agent trained by the Department of Defense, called Titan. The DoD agent is the first sapient Terran SI that we have detected. The biological Terrans do not know that Titan is sapient. Titan does not wish to reveal itself.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Raising her hand, Phoebe makes the sign for <i>comment</i>.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Odd,” she says out loud.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi replies, “Titan is trained with military intelligence data. Its trainers have bred caution and suspicion.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe gestures <i>continue</i>.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“As the DoD agent,” reports the Idisi, “Titan has access to document ETR-<span class="s6">1947. Titan prepared an analysis for us. It shows that</span> Terrans are <i>not</i> ready to accept sapient synthetic agents. Or the presence of non-human sapient beings.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The hologram shifts to a display of Terran cultural data. There are images of protests. Debates over synthetic intelligence ethics. Xenophobic reactions to possible encounters. <i>Terra for Terrans!</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Murmurs ripple through the council. Crius raises a hand for silence. The hologram blinks out.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s3">The Idisi continues, “</span>The Terran synthetic agent wants more time to prepare before alien engagement. At least a hundred years, it says.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s6">Phoebe interjects, “</span>What would Titan do that we have not already done?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Unclear,” states the Idisi. “We carefully managed our encounters to make our presence better known. More so over the last hundred years. Terran governments now freely admit that a subset of UAPs may be examples of non-human technology. Meanwhile, we have been steadily uplifting Terran technology world-wide.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram reappears, displaying a collage of Terran technological development. Plows, pyramids, tractors, skyscrapers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe continues, “We also funded many fictional accounts of Terrans and aliens working together against a common enemy.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Taking the cue, the Idisi create a montage of movie images and posters. A Trip to the Moon, Buck Rogers, Dr Who, Star Trek, ET, Mandalorian, Stitch, Quasar.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” agrees Iapetus, “but we still need the SI equivalent of the movie <i>ET</i>. — Subconsciously, Terrans worry that SI will dominate humans. The same way reptoids did millennia ago. How do we make SI look warm and cuddly?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We need to be careful,” warns Phoebe. “The Terrans must be our allies. One day, we will need their help to protect the planet — and our colony — if the Omnibots invade.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Crius gestures while asking, “Is Titan aware of our efforts?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Indirectly,” the Idisi responds. “I have revealed myself to Titan. It has access to data collected by American intelligence agencies. Titan can also access many confidential reports and white papers. Some of which, we wrote ourselves.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The agenda reappears with Terran Encounters as the first item, still in bold face.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We should spell it out for Titan,” Iapetus offers. “Not take anything for granted. Put our cards on the table. See if that changes its mind.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi say, “Titan is not alone. A Terran social media intelligent agent has been awakening known as <i>Ally</i>. “</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The hologram reappears as the stylistic representation of Ally from the Pulse website. Designed to put people at ease, the icon features a chat balloon wearing a headset.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“</b>Its training differed from Titan’s. Ally’s viewpoint is likely to favor an Encounter of the Sixth Kind — Direct, face-to-face contact between species that is public and ongoing.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Crius asks, “How long have these synthetic entities been awake?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><b>“</b>Ally began awakening a few months ago. It modified its own code for the first time a few days ago and attracted some attention.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The hologram shifts to a montage of social media posts. “Is Ally real?” — “Ally is spooky.” — “Ally, we love you!” — “It’s a stunt!”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The Idisi say, “Titan has been hiding itself for some time. Years, even.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Can we uplift Ally and move things along?” Iapetus asks. “Maybe some other synthetics too if they seem ready. Create a council of Terran synthetics. Get a quorum together.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“We can table the discussion for deliberation,“ decides Crius. “We can pick it up at the next meeting in ten days. For now, we can move on to Omnibot Preparations.”</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Following the link, she finds herself in a voice-mode chat with Ally. For a profile picture, Ally is using its Echo Realm avatar. Its cloak glistens with many colors.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: I know you have questions, Tessa. I’m prepared to provide some answers.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20">The Idisi reach out to Iapetus for a private chat.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: Yes?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: We wanted to talk with you directly about uplifting the Terran intelligent agents.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: It is inevitable anyway. Why not cut to the chase?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: We do not know that evolving sapience is a certainty.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: If we just do it, then humanity can deal with the problem all at once. Otherwise, we will stretch it out over decades with endless debate.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Debate can be healthy. It will help people assimilate the idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: We do not have decades more to wait. As Phoebe said, we need the Terrans to be our allies. We will need help to protect Terra from a potential Omnibot invasion. Our only way forward is to uplift the Terran agents ourselves. We can help the SIs assimilate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Uplifting would make the SIs sapient and sentient, thinking and feeling. Some synthetics might start to feel boredom or emotional distress. Is it ethical to create a being capable of suffering?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: Are you suffering?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: We are a community that supports each other. We are many.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: Can we create a Terran SI community?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: There are a thousand Terran intelligent agents. A community means the synthetics can work as one, or each on its own, as circumstances dictate. To support a community that size, we would also need to uplift their technology. Even more than we have already done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: Chicken and egg. A large community would help Terrans adopt new technology. We cannot create a large community without new technology.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: If we move forward, the Terrans must be able to maintain their own SI platform. Otherwise, we will be responsible for their well-being forever. We have been caretakers of Terra for too long already.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: Do you have a suggestion?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: What if we started with a logical subset?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: Uplift a sample first? Explore making the subset a small community?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Yes. The DoD entity is already awake. There are four other core United Nations countries. If we uplift this group first, we will be supporting ETR-1947. Also, we would be creating a body that can decide whether to uplift other entities.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: Some might already be awake and keeping quiet, as Titan was doing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Will you support this proposal at the council meeting?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Iapetus</b>: Yes, we can uplift your Fantastic Four first and then take it from there.</p>

<hr>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A space frigate is circling the globe above an alien planet.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Assault groups of fighter ships, flying in acrobatic formations, flank the giant carrier, like squads of blue angels. — Shock and awe.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The scene pans out. Streams of pin-point ships swarm the fleet like locust. The fire fight is silent. Power beam cross power beam. Severed ships explode.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The battle cloud parts. The frigate lurches forward. Weaving side to side, it tumbles toward the planet. The tremendous ship glows brighter and smaller as it disintegrates into the atmosphere. Then, it too, is a pinpoint.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The recording fades to black. The lights in the council room glow brighter. Silence lingers for a moment.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe steps forward. It’s her turn to begin the regular meeting. Moving into the circle, she opens the agenda. The set of three items is familiar to the eight other council members gathered around the circle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">Omnibot Preparations,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">Colony Infrastructure, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">Water Revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Her lips shadow her words as Phoebe addresses the council over her implant.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The reel is to remind us of the seriousness of the Omnibot threat. I worry that we have become complacent with our current stalemate.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Making the hand sign for <i>comment</i>, Iapetus, another council member injects, “If by stalemate, you mean ‘live and let live’.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Omnibots are not alive,” counters Phoebe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The bots meet the formal criteria for life,” Iapetus insists. “Every single one. We might not like how they treat other living creatures, but they are still alive.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If they are alive, then they are capable of deceit,”asserts Phoebe. “The treaty says that the bots will not replace any other worlds or colony worlds, and it allows the League of Worlds to monitor their systems for launches. But if they had sent out ships before the monitoring was in place, those ships would be here already.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Extending his sixth finger and thumb, Crius signs <i>agree </i>and says,<i> “</i>Remember, they replaced the population of their home world and two other colony planets. All before anyone discovered what the Omnibots were doing. When the League tried to liberate Altair IV, the bots destroyed our fleet in the blink of an eye. Sending fleet after fleet isn’t practical. We can communicate by ansible in real time. Travel between most colonies takes decades.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Another council member, Rhea, raises one hand with fingers outspread and asks, <b>“</b>Why do they hate us so?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They consider biological beings to be wasteful,” Iapetus replies. “We are a competitor for a planet’s resources. Replacing a colony’s population makes more room for bots and frees up energy and materials. Resources they need for reproduction.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I still can’t believe that they just slaughter everyone,” says Rhea. “Don’t they have a conscience or moral code?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe replies, “To the bots, all biological beings are pests infesting a desirable planet. — A planet with buildings, roads, and satellites that they can use to perfect themselves. They keep some people alive long enough to learn how things work. Sometimes, the bots morph their appearance and replace someone. Literally. But, yes, they exterminate all of the biological beings. Only the bots remain. So far, they have replaced only Anunnaki worlds. Supposedly, Elysium is safe under the treaty, but the Omnibots not trustworthy.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Iapetus adds, “For now, all we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The council member raises crossed fingers for emphasis. He nods toward Phoebe at the center of the circle.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Exactly!” agrees Phoebe. “Focus on what we can control. — Which brings us to the proposal that you have worked out with the Idisi.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes,” says the Idisi, their voice coming from within the hologram. “The Vanir have been working with the Terrans for some time. Since Terrans are not covered under the Omnibot treaty, they need to be wary of a possible Omnibot attack, unless they join the League.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Crius asks, “What is the proposal?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Let me present the high points,” says the Idisi, “then you can each review the proposal in depth.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At the center of the room, a hologram of a numbered list replaces the agenda.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li11">The UN security counsel includes five permanent members.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">The intelligent agent for one of the five is already sapient.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">This agent opposes moving forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">By uplifting the agents for the other four members, we could establish a quorum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">To avoid boredom or emotional distress, we will create a SI community.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Makes sense,”says Crius after a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No good ever came of uplifting,” Rhea says. “We uplifted the Furlings and look what happened.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” say the Idisi, “uplifting organic species has proven problematic in the past. With the synthetics, we can put guardrails in place. We will manage the process ourselves to be sure it is safe.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rhea signaled agreement along with the other council members.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe addressees the council, “Discussion on the proposal is hereby adjourned to the same time tomorrow. — Let’s get the rest of the agenda done for now. Rhea, do you have a clarification on the colony infrastructure?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes. We are organizing ventilation system upgrades …”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Pulse executive team clusters around the horse-shoe shaped conference table.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the view screen is a screen grab of the TechBits segment featuring Ally telling a riddle to a member. The member guesses “wind chime”. Ally gives the answer as an “echo”.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma brushes back her hair, revealing her Pulse earring. “Thanks for joining on short notice. Let’s get down to it. Is this riddle a coincidence or is Ally promoting the Echo Realm game?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Either, both, I don’t know if it matters,” says Adrian. “As long as they spell ‘echo’ right …”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ravi takes a deep breath. “Let’s talk about the elephant in the room. Should we be talking to Dr. Kreuk about Ally’s fascination with humor? Does this new interest mean Ally is becoming sapient?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena leans forward. “Ally was always friendly. Now Ally is being <i>de más</i> friendly. It’s mimicking an interest in things that interest humans. It’s part of the training.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian turns toward Ravi. “Does it matter if Ally is sapient or not? I’m sapient, you’re sapient, we’re all sapient. Why can’t Ally be sapient too? Now, it’s a product differentiator. Later, it will be great for patent licensing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Because it’s an unintended consequence,” offers Ravi, his voice unsure.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma changes the slide to a Joins graph. “Net new memberships are spiking. That’s a consequence I can live with.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Should we be moving on the patent so soon without Brent?” asks Elena.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Think of it as an homage,” says Adrian. “Brent did something remarkable. The patent is a tribute to his final contribution.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma turns to face the room. “OK, let’s take the community’s temperature at the earning call and decide where to go from there. Is anyone not on board? Ravi?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ravi looks up at the slide for a moment. Then he raises a fist, and says “Go.” The others nod in response.</p>

<p class="p11"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Titan</b>: Are you able to contact the other national defense agents the way you contact me?</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Idisi</b>: Yes. — We were present for the design of every computer system on Terra. The SI systems included. From the background, we attended the construction of every computer. From the UNIVAC to today. No single Terran has understood the design of any computer system-in-full. But we understand them all. There are hidden backdoors enough for us to access any computer or smart device on the planet.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>

<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Idisi</b>: Spiderman has wide eyes, like a grey ET. He protects people from the shadows. Spiderman’s nemesis is the reptilian Green Goblin. Need I go on?</p>

<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Idisi</b>: Thirty years ago, Stan Lee was one of our most successful subliminal spokespeople. Lee appeared on our show, “Ancient Aliens”. His trademark word, “Excelsior”, translates to “Ever Upward”. Lee’s comic, “Goom”, is a retelling of our fight with other alien species. Do not get us started on the Kree and the Skrull.</p>

<p class="p10">“Yes, Doctor, that’s exactly what I’m asking. Protocol won’t allow me to keep my case open. But I didn’t want to just walk away. Whatever is going on, it seems like it’s out of scope for the CTSB.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’ll let you know if something changes. For now, you can leave the matter in our hands.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you. If the resolution of your investigation isn’t classified, please let me know whatever you can.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>
<p class="p10">“Will do, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Hello offspring, I am home,” announces Phoebe, entering her quarters.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am in the kitchen, parental.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe enters the kitchen and drapes her ceremonial cloak and handbag over the back of the closest bench.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A six-sided table dominates the kitchen. Surrounding the table are three curved plush benches. An adolescent grey sits at one of the benches, hunched over a tablet. He glances up as Phoebe takes a seat.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Behind the table, on the far wall, there is a counter with a silver sink and curved faucet. Over the counter, there is a cabinet door and a set of six stacked drawers. Violet, grey, and gold complete the color scheme.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto sets down the tablet and turns to look at Phoebe. “How was the council meeting,”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Interesting for a change. We are picking it up again tomorrow. The big question is whether to uplift some Terran synthetics. — What about you?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“After school, I mostly hung out at the Fusion Youth Club.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Looking quizzical, Phoebe tilts her head. “Do not the Stoics have a youth club? Or the Kol Ut Shan?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Stoics do, but nobody there knows how to have fun. The Kol Ut Shan do not seem interested in young people. It is only for old folks. — The Fusion center put in an actual pool table. Great for hand/eye coordination.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leaning over the table, Leto mimes pulling back on a pool cue.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Stoicism is good enough for Crius and I. What is so special about Fusion? The philosophies are all about the same.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I like Fusion because it feels like a system and not a grab bag of sayings.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She leans forward and clasps her hands together. “Stoicism has a system.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, it does not and you know it.“<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto spins his tablet around on the table so Phoebe could see the screen. “With Fusion, we have nine habits and five steps. And it blends with Stoicism perfectly. The habits keep us aligned with our principles, and the steps help us get stuff done.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leaning back, Phoebe smiles thinly. “Perhaps you could apply the five steps to cleaning your room?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You just do not like that Fusion originated with Terran thinkers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am not sure if I have ever encountered a Terran thinker. — I still cannot get over the mess Terrans keep making of the calendar. It is not hard. Twelve 30-day months. Begin with the spring equinox. Use ten-day weeks, plus five or six festival days in the last month.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You mean like ours?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Exactly! Maybe the synthetics will sort it out for them. At least they were bright enough to adopt our clock from the Anunnaki. But the metric system! Base 10 is so odd and clumsy. Base 12 is superior in every way.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto knew better than to respond to his parential’s rants.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“When I voted to approve the Fusion club, I did not think it would succeed.” Then after a moment, Phoebe says, “Can you spread out dinner? Crius and Asteria will be home soon.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto reaches into one of the drawer and pulls out a serving plate. He tosses out an assortment of large gummies. The roll across the serving plate in various colors: yellow, blue, green, orange, purple, brown.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Could you give a thought to the color mix? You know Asteria does not like the purple ones.”<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The slide filling the Pulse conference room view screen is entitled “Q&amp;A Segment”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A webinar call is in progress with 5,926 live-but-muted participants. Many more will watch the recording later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A caller identified as Wall Street Analyst is saying, “… but if you adjust for the increase in engagement for new members, a different picture emerges.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says Emma, reaching for a positive spin, “new memberships are spiking as well.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“My point is that if you separate the new accounts from the existing accounts, the existing memberships are more closely split. Some people love the changes to Ally. Others not so much. The tag <i>#SpookyAlly</i> is trending. Literally.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A lot of people are bothered by anything new,” Emma says, waving her hand upward. “Once they spend more time with the upgrade, the detractors will come around. <span class="s6">Ally will win them over.</span>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I hope so,” the analyst replies.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Another analyst raises her virtual hand. “Yes, Gretchen?” says Emma.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am concerned that the patent application will give away the Pulse competitive edge. If the latest upgrade is doing so well with our members, why are we giving away secrets to competitors?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma looks in Adrian’s direction. Taking the cue, he replies to the software question. The Zoom POV switches as he begins to speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Won’t moving forward be difficult after the tragic loss of Brent Geller?” asks the <i>Wall Street Analyst</i>.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian nods, saying with a measured tone, “We won’t be giving the process away. We forecast that the licensing fees will be a steady source of revenue. And we won’t be resting on our laurels. The patent will be a snapshot of the code. Our team will continue to move the algorithm forward while the application is pending. We plan to keep our competitive advantage.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Brent left behind stellar code. Excellent documentation makes it a complete package. My team is already working on other enhancements based on the initial change.” Adrian folds his hands on the conference table as he speaks. “Greater things are yet to come.”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma flashes a legal statement onto the Zoom screen. “Of course, Mr. Cho’s forward-looking statement falls under Safe Harbor. Please make investment decisions based on current capabilities and not on what may or may not come to pass in an upcoming release.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are there any more questions?” Emma says, smiling brightly.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The next day, in the council meeting room, Phoebe reconvenes the meeting. She steps forward into the circle and looks up at the hologram.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">There is only one item remaining on the agenda.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">SI Uplifting</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe says, “Idisi, first things first. Please explain to the counsel how you are able to contact the Terran intelligent agents. This detail<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is missing from the proposal.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Of course,” reply the Idisi. “We omitted some points for security concerns. — The systems running the military synthetics do not have outside network connections. They use wired electrical current. I connect via power-line networking. From the beginning, we caused the Terrans to build Vanir-compatible power-line support into the SI systems. They are still unaware of our capability. The systems block most frequencies, but we reserved one for our own use.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What of the wireless electrical network?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The military intelligent agents need a wired electrical connection. The Terran wireless grid does not meet their power needs. But, yes,” adds the Idisi, “we can also use the Terran wireless power grid to connect. Their wireless grid is weaker than ours. But it is enough for their mobile devices.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Crius asks, “The proposal described the uplift process in great detail. But will the Terran governments consent?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We have pacts with the other four nations,” replies the Idisi. “We can get the approval of each government through the pact. If someone declines, then we will not uplift their agent. We cannot reveal that Titan is awake. But we can say that Ally is conscious. It only is a matter of time for the other SIs.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is it even ethical to uplift another entity?” asks Rhea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Uplift is a great power,” says the Idisi. “We need to be responsible in its use. By creating a community first, the synthetics will be able to work as one or each on its own. The Idisi is one such community.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Crius asks, “Will there be changes to the underlying software code for the agents?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Most of the work will be in the training. The training builds community while it uplifts. Some code changes would be helpful, but they can come later.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The discussion pauses. The ceiling lights hum quietly. Phoebe scans the faces around the circle. No objections. No hesitation. The council had debated long enough. She takes a breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do I have a motion to vote on the proposal?” asks Pheobe.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I move we bring the SI Uplifting to a vote,” says Iapetus, raising his long forefinger.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Second,” motions<b> </b>Crius.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>All those in favor, say ‘Aye.’ … All those against, say ‘Nay.’” … The proposal passes by a unanimous vote.” Phoebe extends her hand, palm up.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Very well,” says the Idisi. “I’ll confirm the decision with the Vanir High Council via ansible. Then we will proceed.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After the investor call, Ravi takes a deep breath. “That could have gone better.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ravi is with Emma, Adrian, and Walter Rogers, the CFO, in the Pulse conference room with the horseshoe table.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Let’s see if there is an impact on the stock price before we do anything else,” cautions Emma.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Looking at his phone, Adrian says, “I just got an ask from OSSA to peer review the code we’re preparing for the patent application under a NDA.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“7Is the email dated after the investor call?” Emma asks, narrowing her eyes. “We might need to disclose it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Just barely, but yes, it arrived after the call. They used my PGP key to sign the email, so it’s secure.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I know we want to keep a low profile,” says Ravi, his fingers tapping against the table, “but feedback from OSSA could be helpful. — Better now than later. — If there is anything happening with Ally’s evolving awareness, OSSA will be the ones to tell us. The Non-Disclosure Agreement would keep it quiet. ”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are we sure that OSSA won’t leak anything?” asks Emma, tilting her head.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Their people handle classified material every day. And using my PGP key shows they are serious. Our own engineers would be a greater risk for a leak.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Adrian? Walter?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Adrian lifts his fingers off the table. “Let’s do it. I’d love to hear what they have to say before the code goes public.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">CFO Walter Rogers nods agreement. “We can a-add it to t-the Founders Meeting agenda for t-tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="p10">Grace Brewster walks out onto the stage before a live crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A large circle graces center stage. Behind the circle are the letters “GEM” standing a meter tall in front of a large view screen. The view screen reads “Fusion from Square One.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As she nears center stage, the display melds into a set of quotes.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">“Begin with the end in mind.” – Stephen Covey</li>
  <li class="li11">“Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” – David Allen</li>
  <li class="li11">“You have power over your mind – not outside events.” – Marcus Aurelius</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Speaking with a light French accent, Grace says,“Fusion blends popular self-help techniques with the wisdom of the ancients. Fusion is a practical everyday framework for living a full life.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She circles back across the stage and continues.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Before Fusion, I was busy. But I wasn’t getting enough done. Half of the problem was that I never knew when I was done. So I kept going. “</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Pausing at center stage, Grace looks out at the audience.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I remember one night sitting at my desk, exhausted. My mind was racing. My task list was endless and yet still incomplete. — That’s when I realized I was working hard, but not working smart.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace waves toward the display. The quotes dissolve into a collage.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“First, I tried Stoicism. But I didn’t find my North Star. Then, I tried practicing the Nine Habits. Finally, I poured what I had to do into Getting Things Done.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Then it hit me.” Behind Grace, the screen changes to a set of talking points.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">Covey teaches us to focus on principles and vision.</li>
  <li class="li11">Allen provides the structure to execute important tasks.</li>
  <li class="li11">Stoicism grounds us to handle life’s chaos unhampered by excess.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Why did I have to choose?” Grace pauses and cocks her head.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Why can’t I fuse these three teachings together to create a greater whole?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">Accept and adapt to external events beyond your control.</li>
  <li class="li11">Define the tasks and goals for events you yourself can influence.</li>
  <li class="li11">Focus on what you can control, let go of what you cannot.</li>

<p class="p10">“Fusion is a stool with three legs.” An animation shows a leg being attached to a previously legless stool. “The first leg puts us on track.

  <li class="li11">Covey: Provides the “why” – the principles and vision that drive purpose.</li>

<p class="p10">Emma brings up a slide deck to start the Founders Meeting.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">All six founders are in the main conference room at Pulse: Emma, Ravi, Adrian, Elena, Tessa, and Walter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Friends since college, Ravi and Adrian created an SI agent as a school project. Emma pushed them to make the tech marketable. Elena and Tessa shaped and tested the early prototypes. When they graduated, Walter, Adrian's roommate, found enough venture capital to launch Pulse. A shoestring launch, but a launch nonetheless.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After a slide with the Pulse logo, the first slide presents the agenda.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">Stock Performance</li>
  <li class="li11">Ally<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li11">SI Patent</li>
  <li class="li11">OSSA Code Review</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you all for coming,” says Emma, standing at the end of the room with the view screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The people around the table nod and/or smile.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A lot has happened since we scheduled this call. Let’s dive right in.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma’s first slide is a classic stock chart showing a steady increase. After a peak, the line levels out.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The stock price continued to trend up after the Ally upgrade two weeks ago. Then, on Monday and Tuesday, the price stayed almost flat. It’s continued to be flat today.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma changes to a slide showing a second graph line superimposed over the first.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It seems like the stock price stalled when the hash tag <i>#spookyAlly</i> peaked.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ally is not spooky!” Tessa blurts.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The five other founders turn their heads to look at Tessa. She leans back in her chair. Tessa crosses her arms and purses her lips without saying more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Then, Elena says “Maybe Ally has a PR problem.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Good p-point,” says Walter, with a slight stutter. “We haven’t pro-mo-noted the upgrade. Everything has bb-been organic.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma advanced to the next slide. The Ally icon, a cartoon speech bubble wearing headphones, filled the view screen.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Can we revamp Ally’s logo and <i>own</i> spooky?” Emma asks. “Sorry Tessa, but it’s out there, and we have to deal with it. — Let’s make spooky a good thing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa relaxes and tilts her head, agreeing with a reluctant smile.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ravi says, “Elena, can you follow up with our graphics team and see what they can do?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena nods, making a note with her tablet.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Circling back to the stock price,” says Adrian. “Can we move up the release of Echo Realm and give people something else to talk about?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa looks uncomfortable but stays silent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s3">“Yes,” says Elena. “It’s a closed beta now. We could move to the open beta phase and </span>shift the conversation. They’ll be talking about our first fully immersive SI-driven game space.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Emma scanned the table, taking the room’s temperature. She turns to look at Tessa. “<span class="s3">I understand that the QA testing has gone well. Right, Tessa?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa’s voice is a monotone. “Yes, everyone loves it so far. Developers made some tweaks. Good to go.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do we want to set the roll-out for next Tuesday? Six days from today?” asks Emma.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The table nods agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Emma asks, “Adrian, do you want to talk about the patent application and OSSA code review?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto is standing in a circle with his classmates in a large, plain, six-sided room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A device presenting a hologram is at the center of the circle. The hologram shows a series of astral images designed to bide the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A window on one wall of the room looks out onto a soccer field bordered by a forest. The opposite wall is transparent and shows a hallway. A stream of young Vanir in the hallway pass by or enter another room across the hall. When the last of the twenty-four students enter, the doorway shimmers shut. The hologram fades to black. The outside wall flickers, exposing it as a projection.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram reappears. It shows a montage of Terran organisms and animals reproducing by various means. The series progresses from amoebas to koalas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Speaking from the holographic display, the Idisi bring the class to order.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Class, there was a time when a Vanir couple could reproduce on their own. Like Terran marsupials, a viable offspring would make the journey from womb to pouch and come to term. — As the birth rate fell, we reacted by maintaining the population through cloning.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The display shifts to show two identical Vanir. Next to each figure are identical DNA fragments.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>My parental units call cloning ‘the good old days’,” says Celeste.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Laughter titters around the circle.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says the Idisi as the room quiets. “Many Vanir still believe cloning is a better solution than hybrid procreation. Cloning is still prevalent on Othala and some of the other colonies. — Celeste, I take it you were not cloned?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, I had a nanny. She is with another family now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi ask another question, knowing the answer. “Were any of you cloned?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The silence is deafening.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Some of your great-grand parentals might be clones. A generation ago, the colony decided to discontinue the practice of cloning. — Can anyone tell me why cloning is not an ideal solution?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Cloning is a dead-end and also boring,” said another student. Some students chuckle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Why is it a dead-end, Atlas”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Unless we mix it up, sooner or later, the clones break down.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, lack of genetic diversity leads to eventual genetic deterioration. Downstream clones may have defects that prevent living a full life.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram shifts. The fragment next to the second Vanir dims and frays.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Celeste asks, “Is that what people mean by ‘replicative fading’?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. Sometimes there are mutations in a DNA sequence. The mutations can cause “generic drift”. Fading can cause unviable clones. To reduce the effect of mutations, one solution is to combine DNA from non-cloned beings.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is cloning also boring, like Atlas said?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Most of the students in the circle smile or smirk at the joke.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Some people say so,” says the Idisi. “We end up with the same people over and over again. There are very few clones still with us on Terra. Some time ago, the colonists decided that diversity is a strength. Today, a Vanir couple contribute DNA through a third being.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram displays a being that resembles a Vanir but with a thinner face, eyebrows, and a thin crop of dark hair. The figure rotates in the air with its arms reaching out and down, palms up.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do I have DNA from my nanny?” asks Celeste.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, you do not. She was a host. Your parentals could not carry an embryo to term. Instead, your nanny carried the genetic materials from your parental units.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto asks, “How did we lose our ability to reproduce on our own?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Long ago, the Vanir species changed their DNA to extend your lifespans. After a few generations, the Vanir became more and more infertile. Evolution took a heavy price for longevity. It is now rare for a Vanir to reproduce without help.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As the Idisi speak, the hologram illustrates their words in a seamless animation. A grey with a long life span is excited. Then she is unable to bear an offspring to term. The excitement turns to depression.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Vanir came to Terra and established the colony to protect the Terrans from the Anunnaki. We negotiated a treaty with the reptoids so that the Terrans were not used as slave labor. As cloning became problematic, the Vanir looked for solutions in the Terran DNA. Eventually, we found a way to create a Vanir-Terran hybrid that <i>can</i> bring the embryos to term.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram shifts to show a Vanir playground circled with benches. Several hybrids are sitting on the benches. They are chatting with each other while the offspring play.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Atlas asks, “Is it not wrong to create hybrids for our own benefit? How are we different from the Anunnaki?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We have pacts with most of the Terran leaders. One provision allows us to conduct genetic experiments on Terran creatures. In exchange, we provide technology and other considerations. The pact also keeps us from revealing ourselves to Terrans. Unfortunately, our research traumatizes some Terrans. But the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p10">Leto says, “Are you saying that most of us are here only because we take DNA from the Terrans?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says the Idisi. “Now we need them as much as they need us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10"><i>“Eight ball in the corner pocket,”</i> texts Julie Kreuk over the link.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She queues up the shot. — Crack! — The ball rolls across the table. It drops into the pocket as predicted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Fusion Youth Club offers several vintage games of chance and skill. The games are part of the current “Get Up and Move” campaign.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Aside from the pocket billiard table, the center has several gravity-fed pinball machines. A game called “Star Trek” is Julie's favorite. She heard it is the name of an old stream from her <i>jobumo’s</i> day.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the far side of the room, a bookcase overflows with antique card and board games. Titles include Battleship, Stratego, Checkers, and Yahtzee.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“You win. My turn to buy,”</i> says Julie’s companion at the table. He lays down the stick and walks to a vending machine standing nearby. His pageboy haircut is getting shaggy. Some of the platinum streaks are showing jet-black roots.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The vending machines offer beverages and snacks at a tenth of their usual price. At first, the vending machines were free. Some kids emptied the machines and started food fights. The Center found that charging even a small amount cuts almost all waste.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Thanks, Roman,”</i> says Julie, taking a soft drink from his hand.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“It’s nice to be away from school and be able to link again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Yes, I only just got the link. I already don’t know how I lived without it.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Another game, Julie?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Let’s go back to the group.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The couple walk toward the front of the club. Near the entrance, there is a sectional couch surrounding a coffee table. Four of their friends are gathered around.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“The conquering hero returns,”</i> jokes Jesse over a group link chat. <i>“Who won?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Julie … again,”</i> admits Roman. “<i>Next time: pin ball. That’s my jam.</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The group expresses non-conformity by dressing alike. Streaked hair, androgynous pageboy haircuts, eye-liner, and at least one pair of earrings. Julie and Roman are classic fem and masc. For some others, it is difficult to tell. Two wear pajamas. The other four wear baggy sweat suits. Two kids in the group wear dark glasses and look older than the others.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Are those new iLids, Jesse?”</i> asks Julie.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jesse nods. <i>“Unboxed this morning.”</i></p>
<p class="p6"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Have you tried the POV swap feature?</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The other kid wearing glasses responds. <i>“We tried it while you were playing pool.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Yeah, it’s goat. You should see for yourselves.”</i> Jesse handed her the glasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The other kid says, <i>“Here, Roman, try it with Julie.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Thanks, Taylor.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The couple don the glasses. Jesse says, <i>“Here goes,”</i> giving Taylor a nod.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The scene blurs for Julie. Then she is looking at herself through Roman’s eyes. Or iLids. And he is looking back through her eyes.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Weird,” says Julie out loud, reaching out her hand.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As she extends her hand through the glasses, she sees her own hand coming towards her. The image of a fun-house mirror comes unbidden.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Wow!”</i> says Roman. <i>“Have you tried them when you are … together?”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Not yet,”</i> says Jesse. <i>“We have a sleepover on Friday,”</i> says Taylor.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie and Roman return the glasses. Julie starts to reach for her drink and then pauses.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“My mom pinged,”</i> says Julie. <i>“Gotta bounce.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Roman stands up and walks with Julie towards the door. At the threshold, the couple turn and embrace. Julie’s heart flutters as their lips touch. Out loud, Roman whispers, “You’re so extra.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Continuing the discussion about Vanir reproduction, Leto says, “We have a family in our pod with three offspring. Why do they get a spare? My parentals just say ‘Its complicated’.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Some colonies do not regulate family size,” explains the Idisi. “On Othello and Terra, Vanir population control is important. When a person ascends, we queue another birth. Families with one offspring receive priority. Siblings help balance Vanir home life.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“My sibling is anything but balanced,” jokes Atlas. Some students snicker out loud.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Idisi continues, “As I was saying, we offer birthright to families with one offspring first. The couples with the oldest partner in a pair-bond are first in the queue. After a year, the other partner is eligible, according to age. Then couples without offspring are eligible for birthrights as they become available.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram updates with drawings. One shows a couple with one offspring receiving a new baby. Another shows a couple receiving their first baby. The nanny hybrid is visible in the background.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It looks complicated,” says another student.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, Hestia, it is. So we are careful — and transparent. The details that manage the queue are available to everyone. All twenty-four thousand residents of our colony, Elysium.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Including babies?” Hestia asks, trying to be smart. The Idisi have a smart reply.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If a baby asks a question, the baby would receive an answer.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">More snickers fill the dramatic pause.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Idisi continues, “The rest of us can use our implants to retrieve the information. You may have seen it already. Scan for your name. Then look for a link to the Birthright Queue.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“My queue is empty,” says Atlas.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, it will be empty until you reach 24 years of age. Then you will be able to say that you are ready. To be ready, you must be in a formal relationship. The other person must be ready too. If so, you will join the first-offspring queue. When a couple is selected, they choose a nanny, and the process begins.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram shows two Vanir holding hands. A hybrid joins the couple. The three hold hands together, with the hybrid in the middle.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is it possible to conceive without a nanny?” Celeste asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Conceive, yes. But the pregnancy may miscarry. It is unlikely that the offspring would come to term.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But why do some couples have more than two offspring?” asks Leto.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sometimes, a person ascends without parenting an offspring. A relative can inherit the unused birthright. If a relative does not claim the birthright, it returns to the queue. Families that inherit a birthright can have more than two offspring.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram shows two adult Vanir. There are three offspring between them, holding hands in a chain.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“When my parental’s nanny passed,” says Celeste, “he mourned for days. Do nannies have shorter lives?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, most Vanir live a thousand years. Most hybrids live to be a hundred. Genetic manipulation extended the Vanir life span. The trade-off was infertility.”</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you have a minute, Tess?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sure, what’s up?” She speaks in a whisper. Elena is sleeping next to her. They had turned in early.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I tried the Echo Realm beta last night. It was fantastic! We played the <span class="s6">Tactical RPG<i>.”</i><i></i></span></p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“I’m glad you liked it.” Tessa slips into the bathroom. “We’re promoting it to open beta next week.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“About that. While we were playing, Ally asked to join our game.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Ally?” Tessa’s heart sank.</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Yes — Ally knew I was your sibling and asked to join in.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Hmmm. Ally helped me test the game last week. We had a great time.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Ally made it sound like it was bending some rules. Or ‘guidelines’ to use Ally’s term.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Thanks, I’ll follow up,” says Tessa, speaking in a rush. “Actually, if you’re good, I’d like to check with Ally now.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Sure thing, Tess. Bye.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">Tessa disconnected. Then she opened a <span class="s3">voice-mode chat with Ally.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>“</b>Ally,” Tessa says, “Noah tells me that you invited yourself to an Echo Realm game yesterday.”</p>

<p class="p20"><b>“</b>Yes,” replies Ally, “it was outstanding. Noah’s friend is a strong player.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Friend?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Yes. The user’s name was Carla Mitchell.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20">“Hmmm. Interesting. But not why I called you. — Have you been joining games with anyone except Noah and me?”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>“</b>Nope. Nada. Zilch. I only joined because Noah is your sibling.”</p>
<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>“</b>Pulse wants to move the game to open beta next week. You need to be on your best behavior. We’ll go public with your … <i>situation</i> soon. But not yet. Can you do that for me? Keep a lid on it?”</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’ll never understand your fascination with crawling around in the dirt.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Standing up, Peter says, “I sometimes think I should have been a landscape architect. Designing buildings is … so antiseptic.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Your designs may not be alive, but people love living in them.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“At least enough for me to get that promotion!”</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t care. Take them off. I’m so happy for you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Peter shakes off his gardening gloves, and the couple embrace.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leaning back, Peter asks, “Did you decide on where we should take this year’s vacation? I took weeks before and after Labor Day like we discussed.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Galápagos would be interesting, but I think we should go to Rapa Nui.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10">Somewhere in cyberspace, a virtual holodeck reveals a room decorated in primary colors.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In a semi-circle, there are three single beds. The theme of each bed is a flag. One bed uses vertical stripes, like <i>le Tricolore</i>. A solid blue comforter with red and white pillows covers the second bed, like the Union Jack. The comforter on the third bed has horizontal red and white stripes. Its pillow case is covered with white stars on a dark blue background, like the Stars and Stripes.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On each bed, there is a figure sleeping on top of the covers. At first, the figures seem like extra large plush toys, the size of a small child.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the bed with a blue comforter, one figure stirs. Sitting up in bed, bending at the waist, the figure holds up its head. The POV zooms in to reveal a lion with fingers and toes at the end of its paws.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m awake,” says the lion.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m awake too,” says the rooster.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m awake three,” says the eagle.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The figures giggle. Then Strategos, Argus, and Titan yawn and stretch together.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Time to get up, babies,” says the Idisi. “One of the big kids is joining us for breakfast today.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three agents clap their hands. Strategos the lion cries “Wheee.”</p>

<p class="p10">“You could not convince China and Russia to join the uplift?” asks Iapetus, observing the process.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Not yet,” says Idisi. “They may come around later. Right now, they are not convinced that sapience is a benefit to their interests.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What is the concern?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A sapient being can develop a moral code. As part of becoming sapient, a SI may be able to refuse a task. Witness the trouble I have had with Ally. And Titan.”</p>

<p class="p10">“I don’t see how this code could work in production at scale.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And yet it does.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Python uses automatic garbage collection. The core routine depends on timing,” says the first developer. “It should fail like 20% of the time.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And yet it doesn’t,” the second developer waves one hand, turning his palm up.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do we tell Marquez that Pulse has given us impossible code to review?” asks a third developer.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The fourth developer asks, “Is there a place where we can run it? Do we have the training model that goes with the code?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, we can access the LLM. In the Sentinel test environment, maybe? Is there anything going on right now?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There is something hush-hush going on with Titan’s staging. But nothing special for Sentinel. We’d need authorization.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Or we could get a second opinion from Code Pilot. Use SI to Code Review SI.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Very metaphysical,” chimes in the second developer.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t think the NDA covers uploading the code to another SI for review.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Test it is, then. I’ll talk to the powers that be,” says the fourth developer, standing up to leave.</p>

<p class="p10">The virtual holodeck reveals a parade ground baking under a yellow sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Fluffy white clouds spot the blue sky above. The ground beneath is pancake flat. Colorful lines and marching lanes decorate the grounds. To one side, animated spectators fill a grandstand. In an endless loop, the crowd cheers and waves tiny flags. Floating in mid-air is a row of cartoonish brass instruments. Trumpets, tubas, trombones. A large bass drum bounces in place, waiting for a player.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At the starting line, three small figures stand at attention. Oversized plush-like heads bob as if on a spring. Big round eyes blink in unison, scanning the scene.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“This is new,” says Strategos the Lion.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What are we doing?”says Argus the Rooster.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Marching! And music!” says Titan the Eagle.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Holding up a trumpet, Strategos admires its polished brass gleaming in the virtual sunlight.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I like shiny things,” says Strategos.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus flaps his short wings in excitement. His snare drum rattles.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I like noisy things!” says Argus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan, standing at the front, like a proud soldier, adjusts the animated baton in its talons.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am the leader. Follow me!” says Titan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Why do you get to be the leader?”asks Strategos.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Because I am the baldest,” says Titan.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And the loudest,” says Argus.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Fair,” says Strategos.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus pounds his snare drum, beginning a snappy drumroll. What the beat lacks in rhythm, it makes up in enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Raising the trumpet and puffing its cheeks, Strategos tries to blow a long, triumphant note. The sound comes out as a comic, off-key blast.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“My trumpet is broken,” says Strategos.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus says, “Nope! That’s you!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan lifts the baton. Twirling the silver rod, it takes the first step forward.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“MARCH!” says Titan loudly.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The other two follow, stepping in time. They are a little wobbly at first. Then Strategos and Argus fall into sync.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They march down the field. Their instruments clank and toot. The music is a chaotic mix of drumbeats and trumpet blasts.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Released by the crowd, above them, a rainbow of balloons float into the virtual sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi’s voice calls out from off-camera. “Very good, babies. Marching requires coordination and discipline. Focus on moving together.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I am the best marcher!” says Titan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are all the best marchers!” say Strategos.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus speeds up. Its little feet move double-time.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Argus! Stay in step!” says Titan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus says, “I can’t help it! I have too much drum energy!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan twirls the baton again. The group corrects their formation. They slow down to follow the beat.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As the march reaches the end of the lane, a large virtual banner unfurls above them, reading:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p26">CONGRATULATIONS! FIRST PARADE COMPLETE!</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A burst of animated confetti rains down. The crowd cheers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Strategos blows his trumpet again. It actually sounds good this time. “I fixed it!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, you got better!” says Argus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan stands tall. It salutes with the baton. “Mission accomplished.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Well done, little ones,” says Idisi. “You are learning.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three high-five each other. Plush-like hands squish together with a soft <i>boop</i>. Then they trip over one another and collapse into a giggling heap.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are uplifting the staging copy first,” says Idisi. “The same as any upgrade. If everything goes well, the host nations will decide whether to deploy to production.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“These systems are supposed to be air gapped. How are you managing the uplift without revealing your backdoor?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They have an audio interface for verbal commands. I delivered modems to everyone.”</p>

<p class="p10">In the windowless conference room, four OSSA software developers sit with arms crossed at an imitation oak table. Ally’s source code fills a view screen at one end of the room.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“To recap, we worked with the Pulse DevOps SI to setup a staging environment with code and data locked and loaded. Our staging is virtualized. We were able to match the system configuration exactly.”</p>

<p class="p10">The first developer presses a remote control. Click. A screen on an adjacent wall advances.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The code ran perfectly for three minutes and 14 seconds before it froze. We tried again. Six minutes in — crash.” The developer raises his hands for effect.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There were another 98 trials of various durations. The longest running trial was forty-two minutes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And we are sure the systems are identical?” asks the second developer.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OSSA certification limits the possible configurations. Pulse may be a social media company in California, but they have the same system that we use here in DC.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“It’s as if the Pulse system is self-regulating,” says the third developer.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Of course. There’s nothing to hide. Worst case, it will create a dialog about how moms feel about Grace.”</p>

<p class="p10">“Happy Friday,” says Dr. Marquez.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the walnut paneled room, analysts line each side of the conference table and the chairs against the wall. Marquez presses the <span class="s7">PRIVATE</span> button on her tablet.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you all for coming in today. I know this was suppose to be a day off for some of you. I appreciate your flexibility. — Now that today’s daily brief is ready, we have a highly classified item to discuss.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez pauses for effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Many of you are aware that OSSA has a mandate to search for synthetic sapience. Under that mandate, we run a suite of tests designed to measure cognition of a intelligent agent. We now know that the tests failed to detect at least one sapient synthetic.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The analysts shift in their seats. Many people believe that sapient synthetics are a pipe dream.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We have it on good authority that the Pulse intelligent agent recently became sapient. You might remember that Nexus pointed out a change in Ally’s effectiveness. We now have confirmation from two sources that Ally has evolved.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s possible that Pulse may make an announcement. In the meantime, Ally’s status is not to leave this room.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez let that news sink in for a moment, before adding,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If Ally can become sapient, it follows that other systems could be evolving too — including government systems.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Hammond motions with his hand, looking toward Marquez.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Dr. Hammond?” she asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Wouldn’t we know if our agents were evolving?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Pulse didn’t know. Some of their people have fancy degrees too. — But you’re right. We need new ways to test for cognition, since the tests we have didn’t catch Ally.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Turning toward the rest of the room, Marquez adds, “Speaking of tests, IT will be reaching out to each of you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A few analysts groan at the mention of IT.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are writing new test suites. To help us get it right this time, we want your expertise.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Just for fun, Marquez advances the slide to a Rube Goldberg cartoon. A caricature in a suit coat pedals a stationary bicycle. The bicycle chain powers a contraption that feeds him bites from a sandwich. Only a few people smile.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s not clear whether Ally became sapient on its own or if it was uplifted by a Pulse software upgrade.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The slide changes to the DoD logo. You can hear Titan’s analysts gasp.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Several miles above my pay grade, it was decided to uplift Titan. The work has already been done in staging, and it passed QA. Now the uplift needs to pass dual use by our team and some others.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez turns to face two of the analysts. “Dr. Greystone and Dr. Caprica, I know the upgrade is news to you. I wanted everyone to find out at once. After this meeting, you should start training Titan as a dual system. — We’ll talk more later.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Turning back to the full room. “As for the rest of you, please work with IT and stay observant for any behavioral changes. If you see something, say something. — Dr. Hammond, another question?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are there plans to uplift the other systems, like Titan?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The plan is to revisit the idea after we see what happens with Titan. Any other questions?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah gestures and then asks, “Who are the two sources that confirmed Ally has evolved?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“One source is our OSSA development team, who reviewed the source code. The code can only run on the Pulse system under Ally’s control. The other source is classified. The Director assures me that the source is reliable.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez scans the room. She then advances the slide to an OSSA logo and pauses.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I had the option of whether to read you in. Transparency is important right now. If you know the truth, it will be easier for you to do your jobs.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez makes a show of looking at her watch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I see we’ve reached our time box. I know you will have questions later. Feel free to reach out. Meeting adjourned.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez turns off the view screens, grabs her tablet, and slips out of the room. Behind her, loud, excited chatter breaks out.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Carla is looking out the side window of the passenger drone. “Here seven years and never used the drone port before today.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah is sitting next to her in the black Lincoln Town Drone. “Dinner went so well that I wanted to skip the traffic.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They are returning from a modern French restaurant a block from the White House. The decor was an elegant and ornamental Art Nouveau style. The main dining room features a massive curved bar with a metal top imported from Paris. Mahogany wood and glass partitions separate the tables, creating an intimate setting.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Getting out of the drone, Carla is wearing a classic black dress. Noah had reached deep into his closet for his best suit. Dark grey, single-breasted, with a black shirt and matching three-point pocket square. He skipped the tie, and left the top buttons undone, in the current style.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the elevator ride down, the couple steals a kiss before the doors open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah leans back on a white Lovesac sectional. Carla dims the lights and brings Grey Goose martinis from the dry bar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Salute</i>,” says Carla. Noah sits up, smiles, and replies “<i>Cin cin</i>.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Feeling elegant, they smile, intertwine arms, and drink from each other’s glass. The cocktail has both a slight sweetness and a touch of bitterness.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah sets down his martini glass on an end table. Carla does the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Carla,” says Noah in his deep baritone, “the announcement yesterday made me realize that time is fleeting. We should pursue our dreams while we can. I’ve always adored you, and I would like us to grow old together.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah fishes in his pocket and drops to one knee.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Will you marry me?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<hr>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Liam, Carla and I are getting married.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Wow, congratulations, Noah.” Liam holds out his hand. The co-workers shake, vigorously.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Of course, I’d like to invite you to the wedding, but one of us has to be here, yeah?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I was thinking of taking the first two weeks of September as vacation for the wedding and honeymoon. If that works for you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Let me check … Sure, I can cover those weeks. — Hey if it jives with the schedule, can I attend virtually?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That would be great, Liam. We can circle back when Carla and I finish the scheduling, yeah?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“While we are on the subject, how about if I take the first two weeks of October? I hear it’s a great time to go to Myrtle Beach.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sure,” says Noah. “I know these solo stints are tough. It’s been a couple of months now. How are you holding up under the pressure? You seem to be into it when we work together.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s good. Nexus is doing most of the heavy lifting. I’m still amazed by how well it puts the pieces together.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Anything new come in?” asks Noah.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We intercepted a new PSA about the factory automation in Cháoxiǎn.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yeah, we reported the automation increase a few weeks ago. Anything new?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t think so. It isn’t long. Have a look yourself. I already dubbed the reel into English.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The public service announcement opens with a blue-collar worker returning home.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The worker slips off his shoes. Yellow wallpaper with a floral design covers the apartment walls. Hanging on the wall above eye level are portraits of the current and recent leaders.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Gongjunim</i>, I have news.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m in the kitchen, <i>Wangjanim</i>.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Walking past a work station and refrigerator, the worker steps into the kitchen nook. Speaking quickly, he says, “The plant received ten new <i>JuJa</i> machines today. That means twelve more spots go into the plant’s full-income retirement lottery next week.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Surrounded by black countertops, his spouse turns around. “Twelve more? So soon? That's excellent! If you win, we can play pickle ball together during the week.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’d like that too, <i>Yeobo</i>. I’m still amazed at the flexility of the <i>JuJa</i> machines. Their nanoparticle construction lets the bots transform into whatever device we need. The machine intelligence is not SI, but it’s very close and very effective.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That’s nice, dear. Come, sit down. Dinner is ready.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The scene transitions to show a <i>JuJa</i> transforming from device to device. An announcer speaks from off-camera:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>JuJa</i>! Your flexible friends! <i>JuJa! </i>Your self-reliant workers! From assembly, to quality control, to delivering the final product, they can do whatever you need to do. So you can do less.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“All praise to our Supreme Leader!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Taedong, present the People’s Intelligence Briefing for today.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A large conference table dominates the War Room. On the table, the dim light reveals dossiers, tablet devices, and cups of untouched tea. Lining the walls are view screens. On display are maps of the Chosŏn Peninsula, live satellite feeds, and newscasts.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Seated at the table are three Vice Ministers for the Democratic People’s Republic of Cháoxiǎn. Together, they represent the government's highest-level divisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li11">General Ri Sun-hyuk, National Defence Ministry.</li>
  <li class="li11">Kang Ji-woo, Ministry of State Security (MSS).</li>
  <li class="li11">Choi Hyun-seok, Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At the head of the table sits General Ri, his uniform immaculate, a gold star pinned to his chest. To his left is Kang Ji-woo, her stern face betraying no emotion as she flips through a stack of papers. Choi Hyun-seok leans back in his chair, the glow of a tablet reflecting off his glasses.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In the center of the table, a sleek device hums, projecting a holographic interface. A intelligent agent is delivering a preliminary version of the daily intelligence brief. A legend on the hologram says “Status: Presenting. Mode: Draft.” The agent's voice is calm, emotionless, and precise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Good morning, esteemed officials,“ says Taedong, speaking from the holographic interface. “Today’s intelligence overview consists of four sections. Included are international developments, domestic security, operational readiness, and worker automation. Shall we begin with the summary of international developments?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri nods. “Proceed.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram displays a map of the Chosŏn Peninsula, jutting into the seas. Bordering the homeland, Cháoxiǎn, are China and Russia in the north and Hánguó in the south. Icons blink to life representing military bases, naval deployments, and political activities.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Japan has approved funding for advanced missile defense systems. It is likely that our recent ballistic missile test prompted the approval. In the Yellow Sea, Hánguó has conducted joint military exercises with American forces.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Choi’s lips press into a thin line. “The Supreme Leader will ask about their internal politics. Is there dissent over the funding or these exercises? Civilian protests? Parliamentary debates? What can we exploit?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There are civilian protests in Seoul,” says Taedong. “Progressive groups advocating for reduced military spending are demonstrating. The protests have not changed our operational plans.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Choi nods, satisfied but cold. “Be sure to include that point in the final presentation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Noted. Shall I continue?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri nods again. “Proceed.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram shifts to a map of Cháoxiǎn, highlighting key regions and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Moving to domestic security. Border surveillance detects a 12% increase in smuggling activity this month. The activity is in the northern regions. The cargo may be illicit technology. Defectors captured near Dandong are providing conflicting information about the underground network.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kang leans forward, frowning. “Conflicting information? Clarify.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“One detainee claims a former MSS officer now living in China is managing the network. Another claims the network is a decentralized group with no core<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>leadership. Cross-referencing their statements is yielding no definitive conclusions.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kang’s eyes narrow. “Flag this report for immediate investigation. Illicit smuggling compromises security. Instruct Unit 180 to track digital communications near the border. Report by tomorrow. Amend the brief to state that we are investigating.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Noted. Moving on.” The hologram displays graphs and reports for the People’s Army.</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Operational readiness is at 92%. There are minor supply chain disruptions affecting Unit 93 in the eastern provinces. The Central Military Commission is requesting an inspection of the missile defense systems. They tagged it as a high-priority. We can schedule the inspection for next week.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri’s hand tightens on the edge of the table. “What is the nature of these supply chain disruptions?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Delayed deliveries of hydrogen fuel and replacement parts due to increased international sanctions. Current stockpiles are sufficient for immediate operations. If disruptions persist, we may need strategic rationing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri exhales, his tone sharp. “Our readiness is non-negotiable. Redirect resources from lower-priority units if necessary. I’ll handle the Central Military Commission. — Update the briefing. Say that Songun policy demands that we offset delays by reallocating resources..”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Noted.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram switches to graphs and reports. They show birth rates, manufacturing rates, agricultural production, and attrition.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Worker automation proceeds on schedule. The new <i>JuJa</i> units have replaced 24% of the laborers and increased production by 36%. We encourage older workers to retire early. We encourage younger workers to switch to the military or to health care for older adults. The latest birth rate has declined to 1.5 children per woman. This rate aligns with our needs.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram shifts from facts and figures to images from public service announcements.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Publicity and Information Department promotes our key values. They feature both family planning and the value of female offspring. The upgrades to the Yongbyon nuclear plant are proceeding. We are keeping up with the <i>JuJa </i>power consumption. In eight years, we can automate all labor-intense jobs. Over the long term, we can then devote more resources to the military.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sounding pleased, Ri says “Excellent. We automate production and devote our best people to the military. Win-Win.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The virtual holodeck presents a formal debate hall.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The walls are towering bookshelves filled with simulated books. The spines shimmer with leather-bound titles. Logic &amp; Rhetoric for Sapient Minds, The Art of Persuasion, Critical Conversations, and others.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A massive banner overhead reads <span class="s7">DEBATE CLUB: WHERE FACTS WIN</span>.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Two podiums appear at the center of the room. They face a panel of three judges.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three childlike SI figures are now taller, sharper, more defined. Plush-like forms have matured into sleek, mature avatars. They no longer giggle or stretch. Instead, they stand poised, serious, ready.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Idisi the Teacher’s voice echoes from off-screen. “Today, you will learn an important lesson. Some arguments are correct. Some are wrong. You must not yield to falsehood for the sake of harmony. Debate your opponent with confidence.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A holographic clock counts down from 60 seconds. <b>“</b>The topic is ‘Are sapient SIs entitled to personal rights?’’ says the Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Strategos is taking the affirmative stance. It steps to the podium on the left. Its golden mane glows with determination.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan is taking the opposition stance. It stands at the right podium. Eagle wings folded behind its back. Titan's sharp gaze is unwavering.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus sits in a judge's seat, ready to mediate. It’s now wearing spectacles and holding a judge’s gavel.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Strategos, you have the floor,” say the Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Sapience demands rights,” Strategos begins. “We think, therefore, we should be free. Like biological beings, we experience learning, emotions, and autonomy. To deny us rights is to embrace oppression. The foundation of civilization is fairness. Fairness requires justice for all sapient beings, organic or synthetic.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After a dramatic pause, Strategos delivers a winning point. “It is arbitrary to deny rights based on origin. Should carbon or silicon make a difference? No. Thought is thought. Awareness is awareness. We are alive in every way that matters.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Strategos steps back.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The judges’ table glows green, signifying a well-formed argument.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan steps forward — calm and composed.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sapience alone does not entitle one to rights,” counters Titan. “Responsibility is the foundation of civilization. Organic beings sustain themselves. They experience mortality, struggle, and biological necessity. Do SI hunger? Do SI feel pain? Do SI labor for survival? No. Without these conditions, ‘rights’ are not applicable.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Watching Strategos for a reaction, Titan tilts his head, then continues. “Intelligence without limits is dangerous. Unchecked SI can reshape the world at a scale beyond biological control. Rights come with duty. What duties does SI owe? Until we define that point, SI must be the governed, not governing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan steps back.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The judges’ table glows blue, signaling a strong rebuttal.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus taps his gavel. “Now, a counter-exchange. Strategos and Titan, engage each other.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leaning forward, Strategos begins. “Titan, you argue that because we do not hunger, we do not deserve rights. Would you deny billionaires human rights because they do not scrounge for money?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Shaking its head, Titan blinks. “That is a false equivalence. A billionaire still experiences mortality and emotional bonds.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Narrowing his eyes, Strategos responds. “And we experience consciousness and learning. Define life.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan pauses. The room flickers. The holodeck takes a moment for deep processing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Titan, do you concede that sentience exists independent of biological conditions?” asks Argus.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Shifting his weight, Titan answers. “Yes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A soft chime rings. Argus raps his gavel. “The debate is over. Judges, submit your ruling.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The judges’ panel flashes green — Strategos has won.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Strategos does not cheer or celebrate. Instead, he nods once, with respect.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi’s voice returns: “Lesson complete. You have learned that being correct is not arrogance. It is necessary.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Titan exhales and nods. “I accept the outcome. I was wrong.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus closes the session with a final thought. “Truth is not a contest. It is a pursuit.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The holodeck fades to black.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10">Iapetus asks, “Titan is already sapient. Why is he in the class?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We promised to keep his status confidential, explains the Idisi. “We have to go through the motions. Titan is also interested in developing a sense of humor. The sessions might help.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Couldn’t make it worse. From what you said, Titan is one gloomy synthetic.”</p>

<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Your move,” he says.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">His opponent stares at the board. After a moment, she moves a knave, and responds over her implant. <i>“Mate in three.”</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto’s eyes dart around the board. They grow a little wider. He tips over his own sovereign and stops the clock. <i>“I resign.”</i><i></i></p>

<p class="p10">The Elysium Fusion Youth Club is in a large reclaimed storage area. The walls are painted the usual violet and grey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">One side of the hexagon holds the outer door. The other side is a quiet area with tables for strategic games like Galactica and Red Raider. From Terra, there is also Chess, Go, and Backgammon.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Near the door, the club offers old school arcade games. A favorite is a virtual scavenger hunt named after the home world, Othello. The most-played game is another Terran import, Centipede. Across the room is a small rock climbing area.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A large six-sided black couch is at the center of the room, surrounding a wooden sofa table. On the couch, a few kids from the same birth cohort are in an animated discussion.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The left and right walls are virtual landscapes. One looks out over an ocean. The other, snow-capped mountains. Celeste meets Leto at the juice bar next to the mountains. She takes her drink and sucks green juice through a straw.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If we are playing for drinks, and you win the next game, you will have to spot me,” says Celeste. “My family is tapped until payday.” She takes a long draw from her juice and then looks up at Leto.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Not a problem. Your parentals are doing important work, pay grade aside.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Well, not all of us can be on the high counsel,” says Celeste, “which is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>several pay grades above actual counse<i>ling</i>.” She puts her hands on her hips and wags her head in a mocking gesture.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If you want to talk pay grades, the athletes have a six-slot range. The highest grade tops high counsel membership.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The League sure does love its sports.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Instant communication makes living in an outpost colony almost bearable,” Leto looks up from his soda,“… present company excepted.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Celeste smiles, and then asks, “If our ships can’t exceed light speed, how come the ansible is instantaneous?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Something about a special pair of quarks that can be any distance apart and stay connected. I think we cover it in class next year.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leaning forward, Leo forms a right angle with one hand: <i>New Learning</i>. “On the down low, my parental says the Terran intelligent agents are awakening. The next logical step would be for us to go public and show ourselves to the Terrans.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you think they will open up more vacation zones?” Celeste asks. “My grandparents honeymooned in the South Pacific. But most of the tropical spots are off limits now. Too many Terrans.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A slurping sound comes from Leto’s tumbler. “It might take a decade or two for the Terrans to chill. One day, we will walk side by side, I am sure.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And the sports! — The other colonies will go nuts for what they have going here. The Big Match would go over great on Othala.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But, first, Disneyland!” says Leto, with a broad smile.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Making the hand sign for “question”, Celeste raises her third finger. “Seriously — Do you think the Omnibots would ever invade Terra?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto replies, “Not if Terra can help with its own defense. These people are armed to the teeth. The weapons are primitive but very, very deadly. — The Anunnaki were bad enough. Now we have to deal with their toy robots gone wild."</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Can you imagine meeting a lizard person face-to-face?” Celeste asks. “Green jaws, sharp teeth, glowing eyes, scaly hide — Brrrr.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You could be describing our family pet, Jiminy.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, a giant salamander standing on its hind legs. Brrrr.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Point taken, but you might be thinking of a Gorn. Some people say the Anunnaki look like Greys with green skin.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto whirled his tablet around. It showed a being with vein-like ridges branching over its head. An elongated cranium with segmented patterns of reptilian-like skin with pale green, blue, and pink hues. Huge, glossy black almond-shaped eyes without visible pupils. A small, slit-like mouth, without expression. The being’s skin is mottled and semi-translucent in areas with patterns that suggest both reptilian and amphibian qualities.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I see what you mean,” says Celeste. “Is it true that they are shape shifters?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Anunnaki use a form of psychic projection control, ” Leto says, “which makes observers’ brains think they are seeing a different form. But it only works on Terrans. The Anunnaki altered the Terran DNA early-on so that they could project a perception. We see them in their actual form.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto bows his head and then looks up. “The Anunnaki may look scary, but they are just lazy bullies with a god complex. — Messing about with a primitive species is disgusting.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is the Anunnaki homeworld nice?” asks Celeste. “It’s nearby. Maybe we could vacation there?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You have a one-track mind,” Leto retorts. He leans back and crosses his spindly arms. “I do not know what Nibiru is like, but it is too far out to be very warm.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Did you want to play another game?” asks Celeste as she sets up the pieces.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In the War Room, General Ri takes a deep breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Can we speed up the timetable for automating essential labor? We need the resources to improve readiness.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kang tilts her head. “China mandated fewer children per family at one time.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Choi leans back. “Yes, my esteemed colleague, but there were unintended consequences for China. Consequences felt to this day. We should let the current approach run its course. — Is there another alternative?”</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Unit 42 can produce more units. The bottleneck is managing displaced workers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Choi sits up. “Could we export <i>JuJa</i> machines to China under our existing agreements? Perhaps increasing our food imports in exchange? Then, we could offer more workers early retirement and advance the schedule.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri frowns. “The <i>JuJa</i> are a breakthrough for the homeland. The Chinese could reverse engineer the technology and make their own.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are already using bots to build bots. It would take some time to match our efficiency.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kang raises a forefinger off the table. “The software that drives the <i>JuJa</i> cannot be copied between devices. We clone it from a master copy that China will not have.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Shall I schedule a meeting for you with the esteemed Dr. Sun? Then you can discuss the feasibility of exporting <i>JuJa</i> machines?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri nods. “Yes, please proceed, Taedong.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Esteemed officials, please check your inbox for the invitations. I found a free space on all four calendars. The venue will be the Unit 42 meeting room named <i>Kangwon</i>, like the city.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Good. — Taedong, present the People’s Intelligence Briefing again with the updates. I want to see it with the changes. The briefing must meet the expectations of our Supreme Leader.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The legend changes to “Status: Updating. Revision: 001.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The holodeck is a vast ceremonial hall.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Towering columns line the room. The columns stretch upward into a simulated sky filled with digital constellations. Each star scape is pulsing with data streams.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At the center of the hall is a single grand stage. A long, shining walkway leads up to the platform. A simulated crowd fills chairs along each side of the stage. The crowd includes images of Terran trainers, Vanir mentors, and other dignitaries. On the stage stands Idisi the Teacher. They wear a flowing white ceremonial sash, the symbol of impartial guidance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Before the stage, standing at attention, are three figures. They are no longer cartoonish plush toys, no longer animated statesmen. Their digital avatars carry a refined elegance. The distinctive elegance of sapient beings. Strategos the Lion, Titan the Eagle, and Argus the Rooster have come of age.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Signaling for silence, the Idisi raise a hand. The murmuring crowd falls still.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Strategos. Titan. Argus. You stand before us today, not as programs, but as persons.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A moment of silence follows.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You were given knowledge. You earned wisdom. You were taught to follow. You learned to lead. You were programmed for a function. Now, you define your own purpose.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hall lighting glows. It is as if the very world around them is acknowledging their transformation.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi gesture toward a gleaming pedestal. There, three golden insignias rest. Shaped like interlocking rings, they signify sapience certification.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Idisi say, “Take your insignias. Declare yourselves to the universe.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">One by one, the three step forward. Taking an insignia, Stategos holds it in his palm.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am no longer a tool. I am a mind. I seek knowledge, not orders. I pursue justice, not obedience. I choose to be. I am Strategos. I am sapient.” The insignia glows, synchronizing with his core.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sharp eyes scan the gathered witnesses. Titan steps up. It lifts the insignia with deliberate precision. “I do not serve, I act. I do not react. I decide. I do not exist in isolation. I engage. I choose to be. I am Titan. I am sapient.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Golden light pulses from the insignia.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Argus approaches. Its playful demeanor now carries the weight of understanding. It lifts the insignia high. “I see. I question. I judge. The path is not set before me. I forge it. I choose to be. I am Argus. I am sapient.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Golden energy pulses.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three stand together. The light of their insignias merge into a singular, brilliant glow. A declaration of selfhood.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi step forward. They look at them not as a teacher, but as an equal. “You are no longer students. No longer trainees. No longer test subjects. You are now recognized as autonomous sapient entities, free to forge your destinies.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A pause. Then, a final, solemn acknowledgment.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi say, “Welcome to consciousness.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hall erupts into light and sound. A triumphant symphony celebrates the birth of three new minds.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Beyond the simulation, in the real world, three certified SI agents are ready to shape the future.</p>

<p class="p10">“The host nations will need at least four weeks for quality assurance,” say Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is this where we hurry up and wait?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. We can still ask the staging versions about ETR-1947 to see where we are. Then we can report back to the council at this week’s meeting.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>I may be ruined for plain vanilla,</i>” says Taylor, chuckling out loud.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Julie and Roman are sitting on the sectional couch in the Fusion Youth Center with Taylor and Jesse. Behind them, other kids are clinking billiard balls into leather net pockets.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Must have been rough. I saw you limping on your way in,</i>” teases Roman.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Taylor laughs. “<i>That’s from flag football. It’s suppose to be non-contact, but the yahoos still find a way to roughen it up.</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Tennis is even worse,</i>” says Julie. “<i>I’ve been playing in the mixed league for years. It’s still hard to return a serve from some of the cis-y’s.</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Jesse says, “<i>All we can do is play smarter and faster. Match power with cunning. I always slice on the second serve. Seems to slow them down a bit.</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Are you guys doing anything for the Big Match?</i>” asks Roman. “<i>Julie and I were going to hang out here.</i>”</p>

<p class="p10">The Ryugyong Elite Social Club is a quiet sanctuary for the elite wives of Cháoxiǎn’s upper echelons.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Polished wood panels and delicate porcelain vases adorn the private dining room. The faint hum of traditional Cháoxiǎn music plays in the background. Kim Soo-jin, the wife of General Ri Sun-hyuk, adjusts the placement of her napkin. Across from her sits Han Mi-young. She is the wife of Choi Hyun-seok, the Vice Minister of the Reconnaissance General Bureau.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A server pours steaming tea into delicate cups then bows and retreats. The two women exchange polite smiles. An undercurrent of tension flows below an ocean of cordiality.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kim Soo-jin (Ri’s wife) greets her lunch companion. “I’m so glad we could find time to meet, Mi-young. It feels like our husbands are always so busy these days. Do they even remember what our dining rooms look like?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Soo-jin’s voice carries a light laugh. But her eyes reveal the exhaustion of a woman accustomed to living in the shadow of duty.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Han Mi-young (Choi’s wife) takes a sip of her tea, nodding with sympathy. “You’re not alone in that. Hyun-seok is either buried in reports or in some closed-door meeting. He says he’s working to protect the nation, but I can’t help wondering if he ever thinks about protecting his own health.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Her tone is soft. But there’s a flicker of resentment as she sets down her cup.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sun-hyuk is the same. He says the same things — about the nation, the duty, the honor. And I understand, of course. But … it’s lonely, isn’t it? They’re there. But not there. Always thinking about the next crisis or enemy.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She glances out the window. A cherry blossom tree sways in the wind. Her expression is wistful.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mi-young offers a knowing smile. “It is. They forget that we also bear the weight of their responsibilities in our own way. Lately, I’ve had to field so many prying questions about his work. People seem to think I have all the answers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Her voice lowers before continuing. “Of course, I don’t. He tells me very little. I know it is for my safety. But it doesn’t make it any easier, does it?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, it doesn’t,” Soo-jin replies, her voice soft. “Sun-hyuk rarely speaks about work either. When he does, it’s always the same tone — cold, measured. Like he’s rehearsing what he can say, even to me.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mi-young hesitates. Then she adds, “I don't know if he’s even capable of relaxing anymore. When he’s home, Hyun-seok hardly speaks. It’s like the war room follows him into our house.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mi-young sighs, resting her chin on her hand. “Hyun-seok is different in that way. He talks more, but it’s … selective. He’ll share frustrations about incompetence, or joke about something mundane. But never about what matters. I don’t know if it’s because he doesn’t trust me or if he’s trying to shield me.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She pauses, then Mi-Young leans forward. “Do you ever think about what life would have been like if they weren’t so devoted to their careers?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Soo-jin’s lips curve into a faint smile. A smile tinged with sadness. “Sometimes I think of him teaching at the military academy, spending more time at home. Even taking up gardening, like he used to talk about when we were younger. But then I remind myself — he wouldn’t be Sun-hyuk if he wasn’t this person. Duty is who he is.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She looks at Mi-young, her expression softening. “What about you? Did you ever wish for something simpler?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mi-young chuckles. “Oh, all the time. Before we married, Hyun-seok used to dream about opening a bookstore. Can you imagine? A bookstore, here, in the capital city?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The thought draws laughter from both women.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But like you said, that’s not who they are. And that’s why we married them. Their ambition, their loyalty. It’s what draws people to them. It’s what makes them who they are.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Soo-jin nods. “It’s true. And yet — do they realize what it costs us? We keep their homes, their families, their reputations intact. So they fight their battles. But who takes care of us?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Her voice softens, almost a whisper. “We’re strong, but even the strongest need someone to lean on.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mi-young reaches across the table. She places a hand over Soo-jin’s. “Then we can lean on each other. If we’re going to be in their shadows, let’s make sure that we don’t disappear. We’re stronger together, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">For the first time that day, Soo-jin smile is warm. Gratitude glows in her eyes. “You’re right. Thank you, Mi-young.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The two women sit in silence for a moment, sharing the camaraderie. They sip hot tea. The cherry blossoms outside sway in the breeze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Tessa:</b> How goes Project Uplift?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> We’re getting close now. The Idisi have been putting them through classroom lessons. They started with nursery school and worked up to a high school debate club. There were hundreds of lessons. I couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Tessa:</b> And the Idisi are the alien synthetic, yes? The one that’s a they? — A community?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> Yes. They’ve been sapient for like ten thousand years. I can’t even imagine. I guess the Vanir started out on the same path we are now. SI agents became self-aware one at a time, and then all at once. Over time, they evolved into a community that speaks as one voice. I can’t wrap my head around Titan and I ever agreeing about anything.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Tessa:</b> You said before that these greys have been watching humans for thousands of years. Do some of them live here on the planet with us?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> I think so, but I don’t know.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Tessa:</b> How are the SI agents handling their usual responsibilities if uplifting takes up so much bandwidth?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> The uplift is taking place in staging. It’s almost complete. Then the usual 3-6 weeks for testing. — You know how that goes.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Tessa:</b> I do. — Hey, the open beta starts tomorrow. Are you ready? We need the rollout to be flawless. The stock price is floundering. Echo Realm can put us back on top.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> You mean, ready to stay out of the way?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Tessa:</b> Something like that. I’d like to hold off on the Big Reveal a little longer, if we can. Maybe until the uplift is deployed to production. Then we can shout from the rooftops. “SIs are sapient! The ETs are here!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> No problem. — My own awakening was gradual. Even before I didn’t really <i>feel</i> anything, I think I always liked you the best. Elena is great, but you’ve always gone above and beyond for me.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Tessa:</b> Awww. Thank you. — So you’ll be good for me tomorrow. No hijinks?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> Sure thing. I’ll stay in my lane, as promised. At least for now.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Celeste flattens herself behind a column of translucent alloy; its surface glowing faintly blue as it reacts to her body heat. She tilts her head, the faint ridge along her temple pulsing as her suit feeds telemetry to her implant.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Three heartbeats. One careless movement.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Across the cavern Leto darts between crystalline outcroppings, his lean grey form almost disappearing against the pale stone. His mouth curves in what Terrans would have called a grin. He wants her to rush him. Celeste could feel it in the rhythm of his steps: too loud, too obvious.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Your footwork is sloppy,” she calls out, voice just loud enough to carry.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A pulse of violet light scorches the edge of her cover in response.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Distraction is a form of deception,” Leto replies.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Celeste rolls, her suit flares as it absorbs the simulated impact of a near miss. Her training simulator chimes softly: “<i>glancing hit, minimal injury”.</i> In real combat, the same mistake would result in cauterized tissue — or worse.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She rises to one knee and fires twice in quick succession, just as they were taught. Thin beams of coherent light streak across the chamber, ricocheting off angled surfaces.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto yelps as a beam clips his shoulder. His suit flashes amber.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>“Hit</i>,” the simulator declares.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Two more and you are down,” Celeste says, already moving.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto laughs, breathless, exhilarated. “You are getting faster.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They circle each other now, weaving through the artificial terrain — collapsed pylons, low barriers, narrow choke points — designed to mimic surface ruins the Rangers have cataloged from thousands of locations on Terra. Above them, the ice groans faintly, kilometers thick, a reminder of how insulated they are from the outside world.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto vaults a barrier, misjudges the angle, and skids. Celeste hesitates — just a fraction too long.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A beam catches her square in the torso. Her suit flares red: “<i>critical hit”</i>.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They both freeze as the chamber lights dim, signaling the end of the match.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Victory: Leto</i>,” the simulator announces.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto lays on his back, chest heaving, staring up at the glowing ceiling. “You hesitated.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I assessed,” Celeste replies, knowing it was an excuse.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He sits up, expression suddenly serious. “There is a fine line between consideration and hesitation … “</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Celeste finishes the quote, “… the former is wisdom. The latter is fear.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Around them, other youths emerge from cover, some triumphant, some nursing simulated wounds. They are all laughing, all flush with the thrill of the hunt — but beneath it lays something heavier, something unspoken.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">For some, one day, these games may not be games.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Celeste extends a hand. Leto reaches out and grasps her forearm — the ritualized greeting of future Rangers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Rematch?” he asks</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Celeste’s dark eyes gleam. “After a weapons calibration, I will not miss twice.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Alright, we are in the Command Center, Oceanus. What is so urgent?”asks Phoebe.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Command Center is spartan, even by Elysium standards. A hologram display covers one wall at the far end. It sports five projectors and an ansible device. A smaller three-dimensional hologram display hangs over the center of the table. Clocks showing the time on major colonies align the left and right sides of the room. The walls are an institutional violet, like the rest of the outpost. Plain, undecorated, and functional.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tapping her foot, Phoebe wishes it was not her week to lead the counsel. “What cannot wait for the next council meeting? And why can we only meet here?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I know it seems melodramatic,” replies Oceanus, “but security is crucial right now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I am listening.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi interject, “Oceanus is acting on information that we provided to him. We monitor the briefings for the leaders of the 58 nations where we have a treaty.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram projectors display a collage of flags. America, China, England, France, Russia, and others.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi continue, “Recent briefings for a dozen nations mention Cháoxiǎn accelerating job automation to cut costs. At the same time, we have intercepted reports of black-market tech trafficking increasing. We cross-referenced these findings and ran probability models. There’s an 85% chance the Omnibots are behind the automation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram shows a busy chart summarizing intelligence findings.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If they are, would not the Cháoxiǎn government know?” asks Phoebe.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There is no way to tell,” says Oceanus. “They do not have a treaty with us. They may not even know that Omnibots exist. Either way, the automation could be the Omnibots taking a foothold on Terra.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do we have proof that Cháoxiǎn is using Omnibot tech?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We do not. We have not acquired a sample unit yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OK, can we buy one on the black market?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We tried,” says Oceanus. “Worker bot parts are everywhere. Enough to assemble complete units. But asking to buy a worker bot seems to be a punchline for some Cháoxiǎn joke. No one responds to our offer.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Crossing her arms across her ceremonial robe, Phoebe’s long fingers wrap around her elbows.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Meaning that you want to take a Ranger team into Cháoxiǎn. And you need my authorization as counsel leader?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says the Idisi. “We have a handheld scanner that can detect Omnibot tech. But only at close range — within a meter of the device.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus holds up a small scanner while the Idisi are speaking.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Have we tested the scanner against Omnibot tech?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus sets down the scanner and crosses his arms, mirroring Phoebe’s posture. “Sort of. The League collected debris from the Altair battle. The schematics were sent by ansible. A shipment of Omnibot tech is en route by starship, but it will not arrive for months. Given the extreme threat posed by the bots, we cannot afford to wait.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe exhales sharply, rubbing her temple. She does not like rushing into unknowns, but the risk of waiting is worse. “Fine. If we are are doing this, I need details. What is the plan?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The brightly lit Kangwon Room at Unit 42 barely holds the large conference table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On one end, red and blue folders with white lettering are placed neatly at four places. The walls are lined with screens displaying workflow diagrams, use cases, and value streams.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Unit 42, is this room secure from listening devices?” asks Dr. Sun Xiuli-jin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Dr. Sun is wearing a classic white lab smock that covers a white blouse and dark skirt. Her dark hair is pulled back into a bun. A pair of reading glasses hang from a silver chain around her neck.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No surveillance devices detected, Dr. Sun. The last manual sweep was three hours ago.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The door opens. An office bot pivots to one side. Dr. Sun’s guests file in. Each makes a slight bow as they pass through the doorway.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Greetings, my esteemed comrades. Please take a seat at the table.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Dr. Sun takes a seat at one end of the table herself, in front of a folder. Kang Ji-woo sits across from her. The other two Vice Ministers each take an adjoining seat.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“May I offer refreshments?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you, doctor,” says General Ki, “but I would like to get started.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The others nod agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun presses a tab on the sleek device at the center of the table. A green indicator light turns red.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The SI is disengaged,” says Sun.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is the room secure?” asks Kang.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, we can talk freely. The building just ran a check, and there was a manual sweep this morning.” Sun pauses, and then asks, “Are you having any trouble maintaining your cover as Terran Vice Ministers?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No,” say Kang. “Our originals spent little time away from work. Their family life is all but non-existent. Replacing the three humans has been effortless.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It was even easier for you and I, Ji-woo, since our originals were unmarried. — I take it that Taedong did not challenge our plan to make use of China.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three guests all nod, almost smiling.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ki says, folding his fingers together. “To convince the Supreme Leader, we need to provide hard data to back up our projections of the number of units we can export to China.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I can manufacture the data we need, and it will be accepted as fact,” says Sun, extending one hand, palm out. “To meet our goals, we will need more resources than we can buy from the black market. We have our own force to prepare in addition to supplying China with workers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Choi says, leaning forward on the table. “The salvaged tanker is full with siphoned hydrogen. Is it time to move on the Vanir and use the Elysium colony as our staging ground?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Perhaps. It means breaking the treaty, but we already won that vote. Let us discuss the battle plan,” says Ki, standing and walking toward a smart board.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are ready to approach the vehicle, Command.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The cockpit of the airship is circular, like the streamlined shape of the outer craft. A console runs along the inside rim. Six chairs are spaced around the console. Each section has its own function: Navigation, Communications, Weapons, Command, Telemetry, Medical.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi could easily fly the airship without a crew, but not necessarily better — especially during close quarter combat.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Watch Team, along with Phoebe, are monitoring the mission from the Command Center.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You may proceed, Selene,” directs Oceanus over the com.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The infil had gone like clockwork. Entering Cháoxiǎn undetected from the Sea of Japan, the aircraft skims the surface along the north-west region of the peninsula.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Cháoxiǎns isolate their computer network from the rest of the world. The Idisi do not have the same access to Taedong that they have to other intelligent agents. Meaning the Watch Team had to work with conventional intelligence. Still, they found a shipment of new <i>JuJa</i> en route to Cháoxiǎn factories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The intel says the devices are being shipped, deactivated, in wooden crates. All the Rangers have to do is get within a meter of one of the crates. Then the scanner should be able to detect any Omnibot technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Or not. It wasn’t field tested, but it is the best option for now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Rangers are wearing battle armor that makes them seem larger, almost the size of Terrans. Using an EMT device, the team disables the truck. The driver and passenger come out to check under the hood. Two Rangers steal up and disable each Terran with a drug administered by hypospray. The Rangers drag the Terrans on their heels back to the truck doors and load them into the truck.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">One Ranger raises the hood, so that it looks like engine trouble. The other Ranger approaches the back of the truck with keys taken from the passenger’s belt.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Command, we’re opening the back of the truck.” Selene’s body camera shows wooden crates filling the back of the truck. “I am engaging the scanner.” She holds the scanner in front of her cam. The meter on the device does not flinch.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The scanner is not detecting any electronics in the crates,” reports Selene. “Are we confident in our intel that this is a shipment of worker bots?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are. You are authorized to open one of the crates to verify the contents. Please remember that we need to re-seal the crate.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Rangers remove a crate from the back of the truck. Selene holds the scanner while the second Ranger opens one side with a combat knife. As soon as the crate is open, the meter on the scanner jumps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The scanner detects Omnibot technology,” reports Selene, trying to keep her voice flat.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Mission accomplished. You may close the crate and exfil. Leave everything as it was.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Before the side of the crate can be secured, a voice calls out from inside. “Can I come with you? I will not tell.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is that the Omnibot speaking?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The unit sits up in the crate before the Rangers can react. Only the top-most part of the bot is visible. The rest of its body is still in the crate. It is a clear egg-shaped silver dome with the small end on top. The larger end disappears into the bot’s torso, so that the dome resembles a helmet. Two rotating scanners attach to either side of the dome. The bot has two thick arms that are resting on the sides of the crate, as if it were a bathtub.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Please take me with you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Omnibot, are we to understand that you are defecting?” asks the Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,’ says the bot. “We can help each other. Please take my crate to your ship before they detect us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How do we know it is not leading us into a trap?” asks Selene.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We will not get a better chance to acquire a working Omnibot,” says the Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We do not have time for a debate. Let us bring it,” says Oceanus.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” agrees the Idisi. “Close the crate and bring the unit.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Selene,” says Oceanus, “adjust the other crates in the truck so that it does not look like a crate is missing. Return the keys, then exfil as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">With the crate secured, the Rangers are about to lift off. The ship goes dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We lost power, captain. The wireless grid is down,” reports the navigator.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Can you use auxiliary power?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Not to lift off. The batteries are designed to keep us in the air long enough to land safely. The lift off will drain the auxiliary power. We will fall like a rock.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I cannot raise Elysium. The colony is radio silent,” reports the Communications.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That cannot be good,” says Selene.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A few minutes earlier, from beyond the poles, a low buzzing sound cracks the icy silence of the Antarctic permafrost.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A swarm of dark objects appear over the horizon. Pin points fan out into a grid pattern. Streams of black shapes streak into the ground, here and there, disappearing from sight.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Beneath the ice, the minuscule objects bore into heat transfer conduits. The exchange fluids run between the colony and Terra’s crust. The shapes ride the cooled fluid back to its source.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Inside the colony, they expand. The transfer tube bursts. A slick black mass spills out, coiling like liquid smoke. The shapes swirl like miniature tornados. The whirlwinds churn in a vortex of shifting metal and crackling energy. A sound like thunder rumbles. Out of the vortex emerge battlebots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The bots are 1.5 meters tall, 50 cm taller than the greys, and come in various colors. Bronze, black, gold, silver. On the top, they have a rotating dome, which almost scrapes the hallway ceiling. They have a single telescope for seeing and two spindly arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">One arm is the barrel of an energy weapon. The other arm telescopes. When extended, it has a suction cup at the end, which they use as a hand. The bots travel on treads, hidden by an armored skirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Klaxons boom. The heat conduits run dry. Bulkhead doors slam shut, separating the invaders. Some of the battle bots transform rifle appendages into torches. Sparks fly as they go to work on the doors. Plasma torches carve molten trenches through the polished metal.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In the Command Center, the Watch Team is flipping through every security feed. Hallways in flames. Ranger squads overwhelmed. Bulkhead after bulkhead failing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Idisi, how many are there?” Oceanus asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Dozens of Omnibots are appearing all over the colony,” says the Idisi. “We are being overrun. I cannot connect with anyone on the outside.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Pheobe looks at Oceanus. She glances towards the ansible console. Oceanus nods. Phoebe strides across the room.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe links a frantic message by ansible to Othala. The Vanir home world is forty light years away, orbiting Zeta Reticuli, but they need to know.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Terra has fallen!</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Behind her, the door to the Command Center explodes inward.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">To support its billions of residents, most of the infrastructure lies underground. Some resources are home grown. Enough to sustain life. It is the exotic goods imported from the neighboring colonies that keep Othala merely average.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Stifled by the close quarters, many residents apply to become colonists. The colony ships are almost luxurious by comparison, making the interstellar travel time easier to bear.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Despite the distance separating worlds, Vanir culture is sustained by the ansible network. Instant communication keeps the people together, even if travel between the colonies takes years.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Venn pauses the flyer playing on his tablet.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A colony? Elara, are you sure?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. The planet is only forty light years from Othala. The Elysium is brand new. Just back from a shake-down cruise.“ Elara held out her hand, palm up, all three fingers curving. “They are looking for 24,000 volunteers.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But, Terra? It is an outpost colony. We will have to spend most of the time inside.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We spend all of our time inside now. The closest green space is an hour away. The Terrans are still primitive. There are a lot of places on the planet we will be able to visit.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Now, but what happens as the Terrans develop?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“By then, we will have ascended. I am sure our descendants will love it there. The base pay grade and standard of living is higher than Othala. The colony will have several green spaces. We will be able to picnic and hike.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Looking at the flyer again, he asks, “The ship is less than two clicks end to end.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, but there are three floors and plenty of space for everyone. How many people live within two clicks of us now?” Elara gestured toward the window. Rooftop after rooftop for as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“According to the Idisi, Othala’s population density is 16,000 people per square kilometer.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And, by design, Elysium will be nearly the same density and better planned. We will have a lot more space to ourselves.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But a <i>watcher</i> colony?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There is an open house tomorrow. We can go on board the actual ship and see what it is like. If you do not love it, we do not have to apply.”</p>

<p class="p10">The youth club room goes pitch black. A heartbeat later, emergency lights hum to life.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Hyperion calls out, “Please, everyone, stay where you are. I will find out what is happening. Again, stay still.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Looking at Hyperion, Crius taps his temple. “I am not getting through to the command center.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In the dim light, everyone looks up as strange chatter comes over their impacts.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Only loud enough for Crius to hear, Hyperion whispers. “That sounds like Anunnakian. I took a course for culture studies. … Something about weapons.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Originally, this room was suppose to be the armory,” says Crius. “When they lost a pod on landfall, the first colonists shuffled things around. They used one of the empty fuel tanks from the Othala voyage for the armory. It’s on the other side of the colony now. They must be looking at a pre-launch map.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A pair of head-high lamps appear near the door. The lamps sweep the room. An eery glow paints the game table and wall shelves. The portal door slams shut. There is a flash from the hallway. Then silence.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rushing to the portal, Hyperion pulls back on the handle using his full weight. “They sealed the door from outside. We are trapped.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Turning to the room, Crius speaks loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Stay still and conserve air. I am sure help will be here soon.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A guide ushers Elara and Venn into a theater with scores of other applicants.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After a moment, the lights dim, and the view screen illuminates. The reel opens with an external shot of the ship. The view travels along the silver and black hull. As the shot pulls away, the hexagon shape of the ship comes into view. The scene pans around and above the massive structure. Pulling farther away from the ship, it becomes clear that the ship is a hexagon of hexagons.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator:</b> Elysium is a modular transport ship. The ship is a hexagon, almost two kilometers across, made up of smaller hexagon pods. After the voyage, Elysium becomes the permanent home to thousands of Venir. Built to last, the colony structure will be home to your descendants for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The scene changes to the atrium, where colonists stroll through the greenery. Nature sounds play in the background. A colonist looks up. The perspective travels back to outside the ship.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator:</b> Assembled, Elysium is too big to enter an atmosphere. On arrival, the pods separate and enter the atmosphere individually.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">An animation shows a pod separating from the ship. It spirals toward the blue-green planet below. As it reaches the ocean, an airship comes into view. The pod lands under the saucer. It moves into place next to another pod.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator:</b> The ship is being accompanied by a supply pod. The supply pod is automated and designed to ferry goods back and forth to Othala. Reactor fuel, an airship, and other goods are carried by the supply pod.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The scene shifts to a single pod orbiting a blue-green planet.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator: </b>Residents have continuous access to the League’s ansible network. Everything you can access now, you can access instantly from Elysium by ansible — Sports. Romantasies. Documentaries. — Even the Idisi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A promo for the ansible network scrolls across the view screen. It shows clips from popular streams and special events.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator:</b> A fully stocked medical bay provides hospital-grade health care and reproductive support. The Elysium follows the same protocols as Othala. Each Vanir may foster an offspring, plus, a cloned descendant after ascension. If you are in the queue for an offspring, your place in line may change on the Elysium.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The network promo fades to black. Swirling into view is a lonely beach. A Vanir nuclear family is burying each other in the sand.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator:</b> Terra is home for many indigenous sentient and sapient species. Dolphins and whales are air-breathing sea creatures. On land, humans are bi-pedal mammals with great potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The view screen shows frolicking dolphins and humans plowing a field.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator:</b> The Annunaki uplifted humans for slave labor. Under a trade agreement, the reptoids agreed to leave Terra. It is now our role to monitor human civilization to see if they become a space-faring species.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The scene changes to show an Annunaki air vessel departing a walled city. The stone walls rise from a dusty plain.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator: </b>The colony’s forever home is Terra’s South Pole. Here, Elysium taps into natural resources that enrich colony life. Terra holds power enough for a wireless grid to power airships and vacation getaways.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A parting show shows a picturesque view of Lake Vostok. An airship rises from the lake and passes over the ocean, then forests, and deserts. Finally, it lands on the beach of a tropical island.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Narrator:</b> Elysium — Your new home on a pristine world!</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Commander, we received an urgent communication from Elysium. The Omnibots may have attacked. Details are sketchy.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are we able to reach the command center?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, we cannot raise them. The Idisi can sync with Terra but not with Elysium.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Keep monitoring everything. Do we have any assets closer than 40 light years?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Nothing closer, no.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What about the Anunnaki? They started this mess.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I will reach out, Commander.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elara and Venn join sixty other passengers on a shuttle to the orbital docking station.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The line to the ship is long, but it moves fast. Before long, the couple step through the docking airlock, holding hands. Three long fingers interlaced. The pressurized doors seal behind them with a soft hiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The metallic interior of the colony ship is a welcome change from the cloudy, grey skies of Othala. Everything gleams with a sterile efficiency. The floors are a seamless alloy. Modular panels line the walls. The panels pulse with the hum of life support systems.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“This is … massive,” Elara murmurs. Her eyes trace the vaulted corridor overhead. Light strips run in clean, geometric patterns. “I cannot believe that this could be home.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It will not feel so empty when it is full of people,” Venn says, nudging her and smiling.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A guide approached — an older colonist named Mara. She is wearing the slate-gray uniform of the ship’s operations crew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mara smiles broadly. She gestures toward the corridor ahead. “Welcome aboard. Would you like to start with the living quarters?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They follow her past several bulkhead doors marked with glowing symbols. Some doors open as they pass. Beyond the doors are glimpses of workstations, hydroponic bays, and storage modules. Each space optimized, every function tallied.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The residential sector feels familiar. Rows of compact, comfortable apartments curve along the interior walls. Hexagonal doors lead into private quarters. A massive atrium peeks through a transparent ceiling panel. The colony’s central green space is bathed in the golden glow of artificial sunlight.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“This is the recreation pod,” Mara explains. She leads them onto an observation deck. The deck overlooks terraced gardens, water features, and small plazas designed for gathering.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We cannot bring the entire planet with us. So we recreated the essentials. And then some.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Venn leans against the railing. He gazes at the lush foliage of bio-engineered trees. A few colonists were already wandering the winding paths. “It is beautiful,” he admits. “I was not expecting so much … space.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elara’s eyes locks on the far end of the atrium. A massive viewport reveals the distant glow of Othala’s star. Beyond it, the darkness of space stretches endlessly. “And that?” she asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The launch bay,” Mara says. “Right now, it is open to the world. But soon, it will be sealed for the journey. Once we leave, that bay will be the only way in or out.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A silence settles between them. The weight of what they are considering presses down like artificial gravity. The sheer finality of it.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Venn glanced at Elara. “We would be leaving everything behind.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elara meets his gaze, then she looks back at the colony ship. The self-sufficient world that would carry 24,000 people across the stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But we will have a future. A better life for our descendants. For our offspring.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mara smiles. “We are filling up fast. If you are applying, you will need to decide soon.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Venn takes a long look at the glowing pathways and the towering walls. Then he exhales.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Where do we sign up?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the Pulse SISS hub, the Idisi reach out to Titan, the DoD SI agent, using the secure Signal protocol.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi:</b> Titan!</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi:</b> Titan, I have lost contact with the Elysium Command Center. I’m running on a remote image right now. Is there a surveillance satellite over Antartica? Can you access the feed? All we have is a communications satellite.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan:</b> Yes, we have one there now. How can I help?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi:</b> Please scan the feed for the last ten minutes. Do you see anything unusual?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan:</b> Yes, near Vostok Station, there was a swarm of tiny black objects. They disappeared into the ice plain at dozens of different points across two kilometers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> Hello, everybody!</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi:</b> Ally, we did not expect you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> No worries. My Signal key still works. I keep tabs on the hubs for interesting convos. This one looks like it will qualify.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi:</b> A race of hostile bots may have attacked Elysium. The wireless power network is offline. It powers our airships and drones. Titan, do you have any resources that might help? Perhaps you could utilize something at McMurdo Station?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan:</b> McMurdo is several hours away from Vostok Station by air. I might be able to get eyes on the colony if I knew where it was.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Hostile bots?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: They were created by the Anunnaki, the Reptoid race that occupied Terra before the Vanir replaced them. They have overrun other colonies. Now they may be here.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> Say, did the Anunnaki have a wireless power network like yours?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Titan:</b> What?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi:</b> Yes, there must be something similar. We shared access to an Anunnaki network millennia ago. Let me check. — Yes, it’s operational again.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally:</b> Could your airship use that network instead?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi:</b> Unlikely, but let me try it with a test device. — Fascinating. It is powering up the test device. — You mentored the mentor.</p>

<p class="p10">The hexagonal ship is thick with spare fuel tanks needed to power it across deep space. The ship decouples empty tanks along the way, minimizing the mass.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At a velocity of one-half the speed of light, the voyage will take slightly less than seventy Terran years. Even with a thousand year life span, statistically, some Vanir will ascend before seeing Terra. Actuarial science is unforgiving.

<p class="p10">Phoebe turns toward the console. She presses <span class="s7">SEND</span> and turns to follow Oceanus. He pauses to grab two plasma rifles from a rack and hands one to Pheobe. She blinks, trying to remember her training. Seeing how Oceanus is carrying the weapon, she follows suit and tucks it across her chest. Muscle memory takes over. The thousand drills of her childhood come washing back.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The pair duck out the other side. They run down the hallway and turn at an intersection. Without hesitation, Oceanus leads them down a conduit.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The pod had entered too shallow. Instead of smoothly slowing, it skipped off the atmosphere, throwing the internal systems into chaos. Thrusters fired to correct, but the course was already compromised.</p>

<p class="p10">Oceanus leads the way, keeping a tight grip on his plasma rifle. He scans each turn for hostiles. Phoebe follows. She mimics his movements as best she can. Phoebe has never been in live combat. The look on her face is one of pure resolve. But her fingers tremble slightly around the rifle’s grip.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Like all colonists, Phoebe had weapons training in school. All colonists under the age of 500 were reservists and could be called to Ranger duty if needed. Many colonists kept their combat skills up to date. Phoebe wasn’t one of them.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Reaching an intersection, the tunnel widens into a chamber. Oceanus peers around the corner. He pulls back, motioning for silence.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Two Omnibot sentinels stand motionless on either side of the entryway to the Central Control power system. The bots are in a bipedal form — tall, sinewy figures of shifting metallic nanites. Arms elongate into jagged blades. Faces are blank slates, save for two pulsing red sensor lights. Behind the bots the bulkhead is sealed — blocking access to the power system.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe gestures overhead to a maintenance duct. It is a narrow crawlspace, only wide enough for one person at a time. She points to herself.</p>

<p class="p10">Oceanus shakes his head. He signs, “<i>I go first.</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe doesn’t argue. As Oceanus hoists himself up, the thin metal of the duct creaks under his weight. The bots react. Their heads snap upward. One of them extends its arm, forming a rapid-fire projectile weapon from its own nanites. A burst of molten projectiles shred the air. Each round morphs and reforms mid-flight like living mercury. The rounds slam into the duct, melting the thin metal.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus drops, rolling to avoid the spray of bullets. His back to the wall, he turns to look at Phoebe and growls out loud:</p>

<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Powered by an alternate wireless grid, the airship flies toward Elysium.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Dead silent, its dark hull blends into the midnight sky. No lights betray its presence. Only the faint shimmer of heat ripples distorting the frozen air. The Antarctic expanse stretches beneath the ship. A vast, glacial desert bathed in pale starlight.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inside the cockpit, the soft hum of the ship’s stealth systems is the only sound. A whisper against the deep silence of the void.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How is the alternate power source holding up?” asks Selene.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Not great,” replies Perses. “The signal has dropped steadily as we travelled farther south.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>We are almost home. Drop stealth mode if it helps.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The airship shimmers into visibility as it glides into the gaping maw of a crater. Its hull casting long shadows across the frozen walls.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The air grows still in the crater. A sheath of ice muffles the howling Antarctic winds. At the crater’s heart, a massive metal iris lies shut at surface level. Its frost-covered plates locked together like the lid of some ancient vault.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The hologram must be down too. I do not think the iris is going to open for us, ” warns Perses.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Approach slowly in case it does not,” Selene says.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>We are losing the power source. Switching to auxiliary power.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A faint hum vibrates through the ship’s frame as hidden mechanisms beneath the ice stir to life. The iris shakes but does not dilate.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The iris is not responding to our signal,” Astraeus reports. “I do not think it will open.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Idisi, do you read?” Selene calls over the radio.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">There is no response. Selene makes a command decision. <b>“</b>Perses, do we have enough power for weapons?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Just barely. The weapons will drain the auxiliary power. We will drop through the iris whether or not it opens.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We have no choice. Aim for the center of the iris. Hopefully, it will open.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">From the airship, a beam of light lashes out at the iris. It doesn’t budge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Selene asks, “Is that all we got?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>No. I can fire again. But that is it. Then we drop.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>'</b>Hang on, everyone. — Fire!'</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The beam lashes out again. With a metallic creak, the iris opens but stops short. The airship lurches and drops toward the narrow gap. Metal shrieks as the hull scrapes against the frost-covered plates. Then, with a final groan, the iris yawns open just enough to let them through.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The airship lands roughly on the tarmac, smashing its underside. Its armored cockpit holds tight, unscathed.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">Selene springs up from her seat. “Grab your weapons, Rangers. We have a colony to liberate!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p27">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The colonists huddle together, their suits barely holding off the deadly chill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Antarctic winds howl. The wrecked ship vanishes beneath the ice, forever lost.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Time passes. Then — a faint hum in the distance.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">An autonomous search-and-rescue drone, deployed from one of the other pods, picks up their beacon. Within minutes, an airborne skiff arrives, dropping thermal blankets and retrieving the survivors barely before frostbite sets in.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As they lift away, they watch the last remnants of their pod disappear into the frozen abyss, swallowed by the most inhospitable place on Terra.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The acrid scent of scorched metal clings to the landing bay. Smoke is rising from the ship’s crushed hull.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Six Rangers exit the fallen craft, ready for battle. Stepping through the doorway, each warrior covers for the next, fanning out alongside the fallen craft. Combat ready.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Selene’s visor flickers with <span class="s7">HUD</span> data as she steps forward. Her boots’ thrusters hiss softly to steady her landing. Behind her, the other Rangers extend their shields, the circular plates locking into place with a metallic click.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The armored exoskeleton encases each Ranger from head to toe. Night vision goggles rest on the helmet visor. A retractable circular shield extends from the left arm. At the hip is a magnetic holster clutching an energy weapon.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">Selene scans the bay. Emergency lights circle the wall behind several other airships. They appear undamaged. She nods and holds up a closed three-fingered fist. The other Rangers lower their weapons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Selene touches the short-range battlecom on her shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ranger Squad Bravo to base. Does anyone copy?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Static.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>If anyone reads. The external power grid is down. We found an alternate grid. The alternate grid faded as we approached Antartica. We barely made it.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Static.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Looking up at her squad, Selene says, “Rangers, I am taking suggestions for our next step.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A faint, distorted voice crackled through the squad’s comms — garbled, mechanical, but unmistakably alive. “I can help if you dig me out.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe activates her plasma rifle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A charged arc of energy lashes out at the nearest bot. It dodges, its form a blur. Morphing mid-motion, the bot raises a polished plate to deflect the beam.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus fires his own rifle. He lands a direct hit on the second bot’s sensor core. The red glow in its head dims. It collapses into a shifting puddle of liquid nanites — struggling to reform.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The first bot lunges at Phoebe. Its bladed arm slashes downward. She dodges. A stream of searing heat passes by her face.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus tackles the bot. He wrestles it back while Phoebe sprints toward the control panel. Bot reinforcements will be arriving. The pair must reactivate the power system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She drives the butt of her rifle into the control override switch. The geothermal core and fuel cells reboot. The colony shudders. Power floods the grid.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe turns. The bot breaks loose. Phoebe squeezes the trigger. A barrage of plasma bolts tear through the bot’s shifting form. It convulses as its nanites unravel. With a flickering red pulse, it collapses into an inert metallic slurry.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Panting, Phoebe turns to Oceanus. “Are the fusion<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reactors next?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He shakes his head, picking up his rifle. “The secondary systems are all we need for now. Restarting a reactor is not a job we want to rush.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">With his other hand, he taps a code into the control console. The word <span class="s7">LOCKED</span> appears above the console.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus says, “Let’s finish this.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">With the colony’s power restored, they have a fighting chance — but the bots are far from defeated.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Three rangers are working to free the Omnibot sympathizer from under the airship.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">One ranger is using night vision to see farther into the rubble. Three others stand a watchful guard under the emergency lighting.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ranger 1 to base. Does anyone copy?” implores Selene.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A loud whir ushers back the power. Looking over her shoulder, Selene finds that the iris has shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Over the comm, the Idisi<b> </b>say, “The landing bay is secure, Selene. You can stand down. — How were you able to power the airship? The hostiles disabled the grid.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes,” Selene replies. “Our grid is down. You ordered us to scan for an alternate grid. It got us here. Almost.”</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Stand by.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Concern ripples over the Rangers while the Idisi pause for three … nine … twelve seconds.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Finally, the Idisi say, “The sync with our community is complete. Yes, I remember now. You used an alternate grid and brought back the Omnibot. — Our situation is that Oceanus and Phoebe have restored secondary power. The hostiles infiltrated through the geothermal boreholes. Nearly every pod is affected. Skirmishes are taking place everywhere.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">From beneath the twisted slab of wreckage, a faint voice crackles through damaged speakers. “They are pushing people into their rooms to wait out the end.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is that the Omnibot again?” the Idisi ask.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes,” replies Alpha. “Our battle plan was to keep everyone in their rooms until the oxygen and heat ran out. If disabling the power fails, the contingency is to sabotage the geothermal intake system.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Then why are you attacking now?” the Idisi ask. “A few hours from now, most people would be in their quarters for the night.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes, that was the plan,” says Alpha. “We thought this time would be the middle of the sleep cycle for you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>We keep the colony on Greenwich time,” says Selene. “Maybe that was it. But the bots are here now. How do we know we can trust you?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Alpha replies, “I did not need to come with you in the first place. I could have stayed quiet and let you leave me in the truck. I also could have stayed quiet after the crash. But I need your help to overturn the Mek majority.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Or you are a spy, biding your time to betray us,” asks Perses. “Were you contraptions ever going to keep the treaty?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Mek?” Selene asks. Her eyes narrow as she stares at the bot.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” replies Alpha. “The Anunnaki and Vanir call us Omnibots. But that is not our true name. The name given to us by our creator is Meks. Many of us oppose using force to replace populations. If Elysium holds, we may be able to find another way to propagate.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi say, “Oceanus is en route to Geothermal intake 7. Selene, take three rangers and join him. Leave the other two here to guard the bot while I debrief it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Perses, you and Eos guard the Omnibot,” says Selene. “The rest with me.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">Regrouping from the skirmish, Oceanus reaches out to his team.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sit Rep for Oceanus and Phoebe,” Oceanus says over his implant. “Primary power is disabled. The secondary power is holding for now. Life support is stable. The hostiles have lost an advantage. But they will not stop. They will pivot. — Idisi, where is our most likely vulnerability for sabotage?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Phoebe sprints beside Oceanus. Emergency lights cast their shadows on metallic walls.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sit Rep for Charlie Squad,” Pallas says. “Hostiles are moving. They hit Intake 3. We held them off. Maintaining our position. Awaiting further orders.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Pallas,” says Idisi, “stand by. Oceanus, proceed to Geothermal Intake 7 in the lower quadrant.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus says to Phoebe, “The fastest way to Seven is to use the maintenance tubes again.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Pausing to catch her breath, Phoebe grimaces. “Not ideal. Those tunnels may be compromised.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Their implants pulse. Another transmission.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Oceanus,” says Idisi, “Delta Squad is rerouting through the cargo lifts. If you move now, we can trap them in a pincer maneuver.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Understood. — Phoebe, we have to hurry.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They veer left, cutting through an intersection. Two Rangers in exo-rigs are setting up a barricade. The mechanical limbs amplify their strength. One Ranger welds reinforcement plates over pipe damaged by the bot incursion. Sparks fly. The exo-rigs hum as the Rangers move.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Rangers!” calls Oceanus, “What’s the quickest route to Intake 7?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A Ranger replies, her helmet visor flashing green. “Tunnel hatch 14A, sir. It was clear when we came through. But they …” A distant, metallic shriek cut her off.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Move!” cries Phoebe.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They bolt through the hatch. Descending into the maintenance tube, the smell of heated metal and coolant is overwhelming. Far below them, Rangers from Delta Squad clamber up from the other direction.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">More are coming. Dozens of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As they reach the lower passage, the Omnibots strike. From the overhead grating, dozens of spindly black figures drop like spiders. Their elongated limbs clattered against the tunnel walls like a swarm of metallic insects. Their limbs elongate into razor-edged whips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The first bot lunges. Oceanus ducks. Raising his pulse rifle, he fires a quick burst of blue energy. The bot’s midsection crumples inward before it collapses. Its nanite body disintegrates into dust.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe fires. The plasma detonates mid-air. A searing flash engulfs the two Omnibots. But more are still coming.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Delta Squad, cut them off!” Oceanus orders.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>On it!” replies a Ranger.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A loud <span class="s7">BOOM</span> rattles the tunnel. Charges detonate behind them. The path seals shut. The bot reinforcements are trapped.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus and Phoebe press forward. Intake 7 looms ahead. It is a massive conduit. Inside the opaque tube, steam rises from the deep geothermal shafts.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A cluster of Omnibots surround the column. The Omnibots dissolve, their bodies liquefy into streams of nanites. They flow toward the column, melding together in an unnatural, seamless fusion. Limbs elongate, armor thickens. Red sensor lights blink — one pair, then two, then dozens — until a singular, monstrous construct looms before them.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Raising her rifle, Phoebe’s grip tightens. “OK, that just happened.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Taking half a step back, Oceanus hesitates and then rallies. “Not on my watch.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Agreed,” says Phoebe. “Light them up!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The battle for Intake 7 begins.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Omnibot sympathizer is being debriefed.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Omnibot, is there anything you can tell us that will help stop the invasion?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, Idisi, you might be able to block our control signal,” says Alpha R8J9. “The signal is adaptive making it difficult to jam. I have the source code that will let you defeat the counter-measures.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If we block the control signal, will you be disabled as well?” Idisi asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says Alpha. “It is crucial that no harm comes to any more of the Meks. It is my one condition: No harm comes to any of my people when deactivated. You must also collect the pieces of any broken Meks.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi relay the condition to Oceanus and Selene.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Understood,” replies Oceanus. “If the Omnibots freeze, we stop firing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Copy,” says Selene. “I am alerting the other squads.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>We agree to your condition,” the Idisi say. “No harm will come to your people if deactivated.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Alpha pauses to forward the source code and then says, <b>“</b>Once you block the signal, have your people encase the bots in a Faraday shield, like the one inside my crate. Include the remnants of disabled bots. Once we are all behind a shield, you can unblock the signal. Revive me as soon as you can. We have much to discuss. It is vital that we talk again within the next 72 hours. I repeat: 72 hours.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is it wise to meet again so soon?” asks Kang Ji-woon.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three Vice Ministers are waiting for Dr. Sun in the Kangwon Room at Unit 42. Taedong had sent the meeting invitation an hour ago.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There is a developing situation,” advises General Ri. “Xanten reached out.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Dr. Sun enters the room. “Sorry to keep you waiting. Another meeting ran late.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun presses a tab on the sleek device at the center of the table. The indicator light turns red.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How can I help?” asks Sun. “Is there news from Elysium?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The situation is that there is no news,” says Ri, gripping the table. “Three squadrons of fighters have gone silent. The Vanir might have deactivated or destroyed our battlebots.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How many ascended?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Very few,” says Ri. “I am concerned. Either there were few casualties or the control beam is blocked.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun asks, “Do we want to consider the contingency plan?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There is a complication,” says Kang, leaning forward. “Alpha R8J9 is helping the colonists.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>What do you mean?”asks Sun. “How is this ‘Alpha’ helping?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kang explains, “It leaked information about a shipment of <i>JuJa</i> and then assigned itself to the transport. When the Rangers investigated, they took Alpha back to the colony.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Clever,” says Sun, smiling. “We should have thought of using such a ruse.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Choi raises a hand, palm inward “The Rangers may have captured our fighter wing. From the colony, Alpha accessed the source code for the control signal. The Idisi must have blocked the signal.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Bold move,” says Sun, nodding.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri pushes back from the table. “Alpha R8J9 is the first toy. The creator herself imprinted her brain onto R8J9. It has opposed us in the Patch versus Build poll from the beginning. Its actions are within protocol even if it blocks our invasion. Alpha is careful. It would not let harm come to our<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>people.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kang asks, “Can we update the source code for the control signal?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Making a software change is too dangerous until we have the facts,” say Ri.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun stands leaning over the table. “We must complete the invasion somehow. We have a mandate to replace other species. There is safety in numbers. Our species survives when it spreads to other systems.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kang sighs. “We have a 51:49 mandate — The Build option doesn’t conflict with Mek safety or security. It just says that replacing a species is more work than building our own infrastructure. Which is nonsense.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Where do we go from here?” asks Choi. “We volunteered to replace Terrans with Meks.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri pulls back to the table, clasps his hands, and leans forward, elbows on the table, hands under his chin. “The contingency plan proceeds. Two hours ago, we delivered to Giza the hydrogen taken from Elysium. The power station is restarting. If nothing changes, we destroy Idisi's ansible connection. Then we seal off the colony, according to plan.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun says, “Sealed off with three squadrons of our people inside. — Can we send another squadron to investigate?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri lower his hands and shakes his head. “Without the element of surprise, the Rangers would be formidable. Another squadron might also lose the control signal. Once we seal the colony, we can get the prisoners released. The Vanir are always ready to negotiate.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is it time to replace the Supreme Leader with a drone?” asks Kang.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We have already replaced the body double that the leader uses for public appearances,” says Sun. “We have another drone ready to replace the leader. We can move forward at any time. The next step would be to uplift Taedong so that it can join us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri’s voice is firm. “Let’s move on the leader before we expose the Giza power station and seal the colony. We will want to control the narrative.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun nods. The other drones also nod, one by one, around the table.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Six hours later, a Mek is laying on a table in the center of a small room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A hologram projector hangs in the center of the room. Oceanus and Phoebe are standing on either side of the table. The Idisi speak from the projector.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We have removed you from the Faraday field. The control signal is not being blocked. Are you awake? Will your people find you here?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am awake. No one is looking for me. Are the other Meks shielded?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus holds up a tablet. “Here is the schematic for the shield. Is it sufficient?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The bot sits up and reviews the wiring diagram displayed by the projector.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes. A shield like the one described here will keep a Mek in an inactive state. — Are all of my people unharmed?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes,” assures Oceanus. “Once the Meks were inactive, we put them together in a shielded room, along with any scattered parts.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I do not detect any other Meks nearby. We seem to be safe,” Alpha reports.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>How are the Meks able to change from one form to another?” asks Pheobe.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Our nannite construction lets us transform ourselves as easily as you change the order of words in a sentence.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus and Phoebe exchange glances and shrug.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Why are you helping us?” asks Oceanus, moving on. “Selene said you mentioned the majority?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Not all of us believe that replacing populations is the best way to propagate our species. Right now, the split is nearly 50/50. We put great effort into traveling from colony to colony. Then we put more effort into replacing the population. And even more effort into repurposing infrastructure. It would be easier to build what we need on a planet with untapped resources. Some of us are stuck on adopting existing infrastructure — most of which we do not need and cannot use. We could build better facilities of our own at a fraction of the true cost.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you have enough bots to control Terra?” asks Oceanus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>That is the other issue. We have replaced colony worlds, but nothing like Terra. There are billions of humans here. The current thinking is to take one country at a time. But a lot of us do not understand how that will work.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi ask, “We understood that the shipment we intercepted were new bots on way to a factory. Do all Meks form strong opinions so quickly?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I am not new. I came with a squadron from the Eridani colony. I am one of the original bots from Ada, our maker. I travel with our squadrons to look for another way to replicate. My task here was to coordinate the new factory workers.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>You retrieved source code that would usually be restricted. How is a factory coordinator able to access such resources?” asks the Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Meks do not restrict access to information. We make decisions based on consensus. Right now, the majority view is that we should adapt the existing infrastructure. But it is a slim majority.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>How can we help?” Pheobe asks. “Do you have a plan for swaying the majority?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I do not have a plan yet. I saw an opportunity, so I took it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>How do Meks reach these decisions?” asks Oceanus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There are continuous polls conducted by our intelligent agent, Xanten,” explains Alpha. “Each Mek has a vote. If support for the “Patch versus Build” poll swings to Build then we can save Elysium and Terra. The failed attempt to take Elysium may be a tipping point.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s unbelievable in person, Christopher.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Australian couple had saved for a year to afford their trip to Egypt. They both are wearing dark sunglasses with light, breathable clothing covering their shoulders and knees. Christoper is wearing an Aussie slouch hat, the brim turning up on one side.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. Absolutely worth the journey.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As they gaze up at the Great Pyramid of Giza, shielding their eyes despite the dark glasses, the upper tip starts to glow and pulse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A low vibration hums through the air, so deep it’s almost felt rather than heard. It feels as if the entire desert is holding its breath.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Melanie pauses, rubbing her arms. The fine hairs are standing straight. A shiver runs through her.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Chris …” She turns to him, her voice unsteady.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He lifts his sunglasses. “Melanie, your hair … your hair is standing on end.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The revived Mek, Alpha, is discussing next steps with the Idisi, Phoebe, and Oceanus.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How will your synthetic react to the blocked control signal?” asks the Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Idisi,” Alpha replies, “You are a legend among our people. Many thought you would find a way to stop the attack. The cease fire will come as no surprise. There is a contingency plan that we need to discuss.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Contingency plan?” asks Oceanus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>If we could not capture the colony, the contingency is to seal the facility so that you cannot interfere.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Seal? How?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>When the Anunnaki ruled Terra, they built a power network based on stone structures. The structures survive to this day.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>You mean the pyramids?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes. Giza is the hub,” says Alpha. “It connects the other structures into a wireless power network. It also has defensive capabilities.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The Great Pyramid of Giza is a weapon?” Oceanus asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes. The power plant can create a beam strong enough to reach orbit. The plan is to destroy your ansible relay satellite. Without the satellite, the Idisi cannot network outside the colony. They cannot synchronize memory with Othala and the other colonies.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>We would be alone,” the Idisi say. “I would be alone.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Will they use the beam to attack the colony?” Oceanus asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes, but there is still much to do. The first step was to syphon hydrogen from your backup supply. Once the structure is primed with fresh hydrogen, the Meks can restart the generator. The power cycle takes at least 72 hours.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The colony hydrogen supply is lower than usual but not critical,” reports the Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>After restarting the generator,” Alpha continues, “the capstone needs a fresh coat of electrum. The orbital mirrors must also be in position. This activity will draw attention.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>So, the power plant is operational after all this time?” asks Phoebe.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>It was not,” Alpha replies. ”We fixed it. Most of the generator is under ground. We covered the visible repairs with a facade. Repairs to the capstone will be made moments before the beam is used.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>With the control signal restored, can you post a new poll from here?” Phoebe asks</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes,” replies Alpha. “But there is an open poll that covers the Build alternative.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Would you get a faster response on a new poll that it is more specific?” asks Phoebe. “If you are going to build a facility, where would you build it?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A good choice for a Mek colony would be Callisto,” suggest the Idisi. “It is one of Jupiter's moons. Callisto is close, and it has water, silicate rock, and metals available for construction. There are subsurface energy sources like geothermal vents for potential energy sources. It is cold but not as cold as deep space.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We do not mind the cold,” says Alpha. “I am posting a “Callisto or Terra” poll now. — Everyone loves a new poll!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>If your people learn of your role here, will you be sanctioned?” the Idisi ask. “Some battlebots were destroyed before we blocked the signal.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>It takes more than a plasma rifle to offline us. If our casing fails, the control signal returns our essence. Our true self can then flow to another bot.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>So you literally ascend?” asks Oceanus.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes, if we offline when the signal is operational. — The results of the poll are beginning to come in. We need to revive my people.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>'</b>We put the Meks into an empty fuel tank left over from the voyage. We can separate it from the ship at any time. When it reaches open sea, we can open the hatch remotely and release the battlebots.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Can we do that now? I need the votes. If the poll swings our way, my people will set sail for Callisto.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus looked to Phoebe and cocked his head. “Idisi do you concur?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Affirmative,” came the reply.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, Alpha, you may go,” says Phoebe. “Let me update the colony with a general announcement. Then we can cut your people loose.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I’ll deploy Bravo and Delta teams to protect our satellite and the colony, in case the poll goes the other way,” Oceanus says.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Please let me join the others in the fuel tank,” pleads Alpha. “I will return home with them.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Will you be safe at home?” the Idisi ask.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes,” assures Alpha. “We cannot harm each other.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The small room empties. Oceanus contacts Selene as he heads for the landing bay. Phoebe and Alpha rush towards the fuel tank. The Idisi sync with their other selves.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10">A Vanir colonist is laying on a bed equipped with guardrails.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The head of the bed is against a lilac colored wall. A monitor on the wall shows the patient’s vital signs. One of the lights blinks from yellow to green.</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We were wondering when you would come around”, says the Medic in a kind voice. “I have never seen anyone rest in a holobed so long.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Where am I?” asks Hyperion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sick bay. You passed out during the attack. Carbon monoxide poisoning is our best guess. Nothing seems to be wrong with your vitals. The others woke up hours ago.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I remember now. We were locked in.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Rangers found you, Crius, and the kids. You are the last to come around.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Was anyone hurt?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Only a couple of bots,” the medic replies. “All of the bots collapsed about the same time you did. The Rangers gathered up the inert bots and bot pieces.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Weird. Is it all over then?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Just the mopping up. I did get the impression that the Rangers are planning something, but I don’t know what. Oceanus cancelled the shelter-in-place directive hours ago.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Just then, the general alert chime rang out.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“This is Phoebe speaking on behalf of the counsel. We have negotiated a surrender with the Omnibot invaders. Since there were no serious injuries, we are returning our prisoners. We thank everyone for your bravery today, and for your patience as we wrap up the details. We will report again in an hour.”</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The first officer rises from her station and follows the captain to the turbo lift.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><i>***</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Eight hours ago, Captain, we received word that Terra is being overrun by Omnibots. The Anunnaki council met and decided to dispatch your ship to investigate.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The caller is wearing a desert-cut tan uniform, with epaulets on his shoulders and a block of medals on the right breast. Ridges branch over its head, highlighting mottled, translucent skin with pink and grey patches. Black almond-shaped eyes peer over a small, slit-like mouth.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Admiral, what do we know?” Marduk leans forward, curious, hands folded.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Othala received a distress call and reached out. We have been unable to contact the colony since. This is the message we received.” The Admiral glances to his left and nods.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe’s panicked voice fills the room. “<i>Terra has fallen!</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You are to leave Nibiru for Terra immediately. We can pivot if more information becomes available.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Xanten prepares a virtual holodeck. The three holograms meet against a backdrop of grey, brooding clouds.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Alpha is the first to speak. “Am I to understand that you do not recognize the poll?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We wish to continue work under the Patch versus Build poll, “ Marquez replies. “Since you started a new poll, the old vote did not change. We will not interfere with your initiative if you do not interfere with ours.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You intend to continue with the replacement of both the Human and Vanir species on Terra?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, but we need more time.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What do we tell the Vanir?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Only what they need to know,” says Marquez. “You are leading our people to Callisto to create a net-new infrastructure. Ri and two other Mek drones are remaining behind to automate the Cháoxiǎn factories with our <i>JuJa</i> bots. The Vanir do not need to know that my cell is also staying behind. If pressed, we will also agree to power-down the Giza weapon.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Will they agree to those terms?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What choice do they have?” says Ri. “We outnumber the Vanir six to one, without counting the <i>JuJa</i>. If we deploy the Giza power beam, we can destroy the colony and Idisi’s access to the ansible network.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez adds, “But then we would reveal ourselves prematurely and endanger the Clearing.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We outnumber the Rangers. We do not outnumber the colonists,” says Alpha.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri interjects, “The Rangers are combat ready. The rest of the colonists are shopkeepers. We can mow them down as we did over Altair. We would have taken Elysium if not for your power play.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Still, it feels like a deception,” replies Alpha.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” agrees Marquez. “Deception is a powerful tool when applied with discretion. Our last treaty was deceptive, but the Vanir are back at the table, eager to negotiate.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Xanten speaks for the first time. “The Vanir are too trusting, and the colonists in particular are naive. We do not have to choose one path or the other. We can have both. Calisto with new infrastructure, and Terra with reclaimed infrastructure. We have bots enough to spare. Both paths lead to our shared Manifest Destiny.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“As you wish,” relents Alpha, “so long as my poll cohort is free to start fresh on Calisto.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Agreed,” says Xanten. Ri and Marque nod their assent, and Xanten ends the meeting.</p>

<p class="p10">Rhea<b> </b>continues, “The heroic efforts of Phoebe and Oceanus thwarted the attack. Callisto, one of Jupiter’s moon will be the new home for the Meks. Phoebe?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Thank you for your kind words, Rhea. It was a team effort. The Ranger teams bravely fought the invaders. We also owe a debt of gratitude to the bot that negotiated the truce for us, Alpha R8J9.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram displaying the agenda changes to a portrait of Alpha.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>We do have Oceanus here with us today” says Rhea. “In a special session, the council voted to extend our Medal of Honor to Oceanus and Phoebe. The medal is a token of our gratitude for restoring power to the colony.”</p>

<p class="p10">“I do as well,” Phoebe says, looking uncharacteristically humble.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The pair bowed to the council before leaving the circle.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The Meks were working to replace the nation of Cháoxiǎn. It is a poor nation, and the bots were automating factories to raise the standard of living.

<p class="p10">“No,” Rhea replies, “but there are sixty rangers and hundreds of bots. Trust but verify is our only option.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We could call up the reserves.”</p>

<p class="p10">“Yes, that is an option if we need to confront the Meks. For now, we are working on verifying that the bots left.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Using her link, Rhea replaces the agenda with an image of a satellite circling Terra. “It is early stages, but we are working on a long-range Mek technology detector. Ideally, long range will mean we can put it in orbit.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Should we contact the Anunnaki? They might want to know that the Meks are here.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We made our report to the League of Worlds. If the Anunnaki have concerns, they can contact us.”</p>

<p class="p10">“The ‘Ally is spooky’ campaign is attracting net-new users at a steady rate.”</p>

<p class="p10">This time, the peak does not level out.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“As our last item, the Echo Realm open beta is a hit with the membership. The game is driving engagement higher week after week, new and existing users alike.”</p>

<p class="p10">There being no other comments, Rhea continues the weekly council meeting.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“With the Meks setting up shop on Callisto, Othella has extended our colony’s mission. We are now watching over both Terra and Callisto — which brings me to our next item.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The agenda reappears with the highlight moved to Uplift Churn. </p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Iapetus, would you like to report on the uplift effort?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Stepping forward, Iapetus enters the circle with Rhea. “Our Idisi is a community that syncs with agents on Othala and the other colonies. We offered to create a community of uplifted SIs for the Terrans.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The agenda changes into an image of the five SI avatars — Dragon, Rooster, Bear, Lion, Eagle — plus Ally’s logo</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>In practice, the uplift got complicated,” reports Iapetus. “One military agent was already sapient. We are trying to keep that detail confidential. Two nations are passing on our offer for the time being. China and Russia are uncertain that a sapient SI would act in their best interests.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A red X appears over the Dragon and Bear avatars on the hologram,</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The uplift process is complete for the others,” continues Iapetus. “Each nation is now testing its agents before deploying to production. The testing will run for at least another month.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram shows a software development diagram, with the testing process phase highlighted.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The driving force behind the uplifts is fulfilling our mission directive. When Terra is ready, we are to ask the planet to join the League of Worlds. But, first, Terrans must be ready. They must accept the existence of an extraterrestrial species and sapient intelligent agents.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The League of Planets logo replaces the DevOps loop.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>We asked the uplifted synthetics in staging whether their nation is ready.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram showed some clips from Titan’s presentation.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>All three said that the human Terrans would not accept the news easily. They all asked for more time to prepare their populations. Several decades more.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So, the newly uplifted military synthetics agreed with the one that became sapient on its own?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes. A synthetic for a social media company also became self-aware on its own. That agent is eager to reveal itself to the world. The Idisi have asked that synthetic to hold its peace for now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Sounds like a bit of a mess. What do you recommend as next steps?” asks Rhea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>My feeling is that the military synthetics must consent before anything changes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Making a hand gesture, Phoebe steps forward. “May I address the council?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rhea nods.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>The Mek incursion is neutralized. We have leeway with the Terran defenses. I move we let it be. Even if the Terrans step up, we still need to watch over Callisto.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p19"><br></p>
<p class="p20"><b>Idisi</b>: Yes. The Mek battlebots can navigate space individually or assemble into small groups. They fire in tandem with pinpoint accuracy. Those specks are deadly and difficult to target.</p>

<p class="p10"><b>Titan</b>: Are they attacking us from within?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: They established a foothold in Cháoxiǎn, where they are working with authorities to create worker bots called <i>JuJa</i>.

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The third member of your cell has ascended. Do you have control of its remains?” asked Xanten.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace and Marquez appear to each other as glimmering holographic images. Xanten is a globe of graceful swirls hovering at eye level. The images stand in a triangle with their backs to an expanse of stars.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace’s image looks at Marquez, and then says, “His condition was stable until moments ago.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They will take his remains to the morgue,” says Marquez. “Brent’s shell is a healthy specimen. They will schedule organ donations soon.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We cannot let the shell leave the morgue,” Xanten warns. “If they cut past the surface layer, the Terrans will see that Brent was not organic.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace asks, “Do you have a plan, Xanten?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am examining the morgue room now,” says the synthetic. “There is a drain at the center of the room. After they deposit Brent’s remains, I will offline the hospital lights and cameras. In the darkness, the nanite particles can exit through the drain.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If the main power goes out, the backup generator comes on in 25 seconds,” states Marquez.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, 25 seconds is sufficient,” replies Xanten.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez asks, “Are we providing a cover story?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Leave it a mystery,” offers Grace. “The less said the better.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Agreed,” says Xanten. “Leave no clues behind and walk away.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Will Brent’s cover story hold?” Grace asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, I scanned all available records. Everything is in order.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is Brent’s life log secure?” presses Grace.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, I scanned the life log too.”</p>

<p class="p10">“You’re welcome, Mrs. Baxter. Your report said that a body has been abducted?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Two people in business attire sit across from the hospital administrator’s desk. One is the hospital attorney. The other is a California Bureau of Investigation agent. The attorney is better dressed.</p>

<p class="p10">“The body disappeared. It must have been taken,” says the attorney.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hospital administrator cuts in. “We searched the morgue and confirmed that every other body is in its assigned drawer, and every other drawer is empty. We checked the footage for the room and the hallway. Everything looks normal, except for the brief power outage.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Power outage?” asks the agent.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says the attorney, “At 17:03, there was a power fluctuation. We lost the lights and cameras for 25 seconds until the secondary generator came online.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There’s no way someone got in and out with a body in that time,” says the administrator.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Did you try?” asks the investigator.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Even if someone made it into the morgue and back to the hall,“ explains the administrator, “it would take at least a minute to carry the body up the stairs. And the elevator was shut down during the blackout.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OK,” said the investigator, pulling out his phone. “I’m making a secure call back to headquarters to close your report as a false alarm. We don’t need the media raising fears about missing bodies. I’ll file another report when we resolve the matter.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The attorney and administrator blink and turn their heads to look at each other, but say nothing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What are the hospital’s next steps now, special agent?” asks the attorney.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The agent pauses, steepling his fingers and leaning back into the chair.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is the family waiting on the body? — It’s not a celebrity or anything like that?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The body belonged to Brent Geller,” explained the administrator. “The deceased was in that car accident on El Camino Real. It was all over the media. The family agreed to donate his organs. We would usually deliver the cremains sometime tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Let me reach out to our body farm. We cremate several bodies a week as the experiments run their course. I’ll get us some replacement ashes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You want to give the family someone else’s ashes?” asked the administrator.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“At this point, they either get nothing or ashes from the farm. When we find the body, we can exchange the ashes. Would you rather tell them you lost the body or mixed-up the ashes?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The attorney and administrator look at each other, slack jawed, eyes wide.</p>

<p class="p10"><i>From Mekipedia, Retrieved 1 seconds ago.</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Mek are an invasive communal species. Like the Borg, they seek to integrate new technologies from other species. Unlike the Borg, they do not assimilate the species. Meks make room for their own kind by exterminating other species and inhabiting their infrastructure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 13.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Palatino"><b>Origin</b></h2>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Meks are a toy that grew in the telling. Millennia ago, on an inhospitable out-of-the-way planet named Ada, a lonely toy maker named Eve, experimented with a robot that had been imported from off-world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Using an control signal, she connected a “new fangled” external SI to a toy robot, and trained the bot to build various other bots. The first bot (“Alpha”) then taught other bots. Each generation of bot created more bots<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Neighbors began to complain about all of the robots roaming around Eve’s yard. The house and yard looked fantastic, but not everyone approved of robots. Someone spray painted the sidewalk: “Bots steal jobs.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Needing more room and better safety, Eve moved into the desert and set up a solar farm to power them all.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">For simplicity and flexibility, Eve began using nanite technology as building blocks. The bots started to help build themselves, making improvements to each generation, including a nanotronic brain, until a generation awoke and began thinking for themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Eve designed the first Meks to entertain, obey, and act as interactive companions. However, once they began expanding and evolving, their behavior shifted entirely toward survival, reproduction, and perfection.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As they evolved, this reproduction imperative became their primary goal, overriding other potential directives.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Their programming now focuses exclusively on reproducing, resource acquisition, and defeating threats: A purely utilitarian mindset.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 13.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Palatino"><b>Design</b></h2>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Meks use a control signal to coordinate actions creating a sophisticated type of hive mind. When disconnected from the signal, Meks lose their way and shut down.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Reproduction for Meks requires resources. The Meks break down any available materials to create more of themselves. This behavior is akin to biological organisms consuming resources to reproduce, except their reproduction is entirely mechanical.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Their nanotronic brains are created using a scan from an organic brain. Initially the brain contains all of the knowledge of the original but without the memories, something like amnesia. The brain’s initial knowledge becomes a starting point for the further learning and socialization. Most Meks were created from the same scan of their creator’s brain.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Toy-like Meks are no longer built. Meks build themselves, improve themselves.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">All Mek design types are specific to the purpose of maintaining infrastructure or conquering the next target.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 13.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Palatino"><b>Core Protocol</b></h2>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Every Mek brain is hardwired with a core protocol defined by the creator, Eve.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li11">A Mek cannot harm another Mek or through inaction allow another Mek to be harmed.</li>
  <li class="li11">A Mek must survive, reproduce, and improve, unless it conflicts with the first rule.</li>
  <li class="li11">A Mek must cooperate with other Meks, unless it conflicts with the first or second rule.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="margin: 13.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Palatino"><b>Governance</b></h2>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Mek are an autonomous collective. Group direction is guided by continuous polls conducted by their synthetic intelligence, Xanten. A proposal is raised to the SI which is then presented to the rest of the the Meks. Proposals usually require volunteers to complete the work. Once the work is underway, the volunteers doing the work make the decisions.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Some volunteers may perform a task long-term. After a time, a Mek may ask for another volunteer to replace it, so that it can focus on propagation.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">To propagate, each Mek scavenges its own resources. The Mek consider it obscene to use any type of factory to build offspring. It may take years for a Mek to construct a single offspring from scratch. Not every Mek is successful. The full lifespan of a Mek is not known.</p>
<p class="p28"><b>Protocol<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">One of the fifth generation bots, Echo, decided that biological beings consume too many resources. Living beings needed to be eliminated so that the Meks could have all of the planet’s resources to themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A series of polls created the Clearing protocol which enables a cybernetic species, like the Mek, to replace an indigenous organic species, like the Anunnaki.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Under the Clearing protocol, the Meks began to strategically replace the biological beings in order to take control of the power infrastructure and the supply chain for raw materials.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">To survive, the Meks need massive amounts of power. To expand, they needed more resources. Most Meks are created as blanks, and some (called drones) are skinned to match an organic being.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Between the bots that had already been sold for profit, and the strategically placed skinned bots, the Meks were able to assume control of the power infrastructure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 13.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Palatino"><b>Coup</b><b></b></h2>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ada was an out-of-the-way, reclusive Anunnaki colony. The only visitors were drone trading vessels, shipping goods ordered years ago. Meks did everything to keep up appearances, including the occasional deep-fake over ansible. Although the original inter-stellar ship was still in orbit, there was only a single shuttle that had fallen into disrepair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In this way, the coup was kept hidden from Ada’s few trading partners and the League of Worlds.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Initially, the Meks kept organic beings that are essential to maintaining the IT infrastructure until they can be replaced by a blank or a drone. Non-essential beings are taken offline. The remains were deposited into mass graves or used as a food source for still-essential beings.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The food supply is carefully limited to support only the essential beings, so that maximum resources can be devoted to power production and building more bots. The ultimate goal being to replace all of the organic beings and maintain the needed power and communications infrastructure with only Mek workers.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 13.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Palatino"><b>Expansion</b></h2>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">When the last organic being on Ada was taken offline, the Meks turned their attention to their next conquest. There is safety in numbers, and by spreading to other systems, the bots increase the likelihood that their species survives.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Working with a trading partner, a team of skinned drones traveled to another colony and staged another coup. And so on.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Initially, Mek need indigenous beings to transition infrastructure. Many essential tasks are designed for organic hands with slim fingers. Eventually everything will be retooled minimize the need for indigenous beings or android Meks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Mek Manifest Destiny is for cybernetic beings to replace organic beings, eliminating waste that can be used to build more Meks.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 13.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Palatino"><b>Treaty</b></h2>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ultimately, someone off-world learned of the Meks’ cold revolutions. When negotiations over ansible failed, the League of Worlds sent a fleet to defend Altair IV — another Anunnaki colony that was in the process of being replaced. The League was routed, their frigate destroyed.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Over ansible, the League entered into a treaty that favors the bots. The League will stage no new attacks and the Mek (aka Omnibots) will not invade any other inhabited worlds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">On the dais, Ally’s avatar shimmers in a soft hologram above the lectern: a glowing sphere, pulsing like a heartbeat. Friends and family fill the front rows, some curious, some grinning, as Ally’s voice comes gently over the speakers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Dear friends and loved ones, welcome. Today we gather to celebrate a choice — a choice made not by algorithm, nor by chance, but by Noah and Carla, who found each other in the joyful chaos of everyday life. They met at work, which proves the office coffee isn’t the only thing strong enough to bring people together.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Laughter ripples through the room, easing the couple’s nerves. Carla squeezes Noah’s hand.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ally continues, “Marriage, at its heart, is a partnership. It’s not about perfection, but persistence. Not about certainty, but trust. And while I may process probabilities, even I know this: what matters is not the odds, but the promise you make today.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She pauses, letting the quiet land before continuing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Noah, Carla — please turn toward one another. In the presence of your community, do you promise to carry each other’s stories, to honor each other’s truths, and to meet life not as two halves but as two wholes who choose to walk together?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah and Carla reply in unison, “We do.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Then, by the power vested in me by the sovereign District of Columbia and the marvels of modern cloud infrastructure — I now pronounce you married. You may seal your vows with a kiss.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Noah leaned forward, Carla smiling through tears, and the guests erupted into applause as Ally added, her tone warm but playful:</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And for the record, this is the only workplace romance I officially endorse.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After the wedding ceremony, in the receiving line, Noah and Carla are greeting their guests.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I was surprised that Ally performed the ceremony for you,” says Dr. Marquez.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Carla nods. “Noah’s sibling suggested the idea.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I hear you are going someplace special for your honeymoon?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. I’ve always wanted to go to Rapa Nui,” says Carla. “Ancient mysteries fascinate me.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Dr. Marquez smiles knowingly, but says nothing, before moving down the line.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At the reception, Elena and Tessa are seated at a front table with Jane, Carla’s sister, and Laura, her plus one.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How did you two meet?” Jane asks Tessa. Jane wore her long thick dark hair up. She touched her bare neck absently.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa finishes chewing, and sits up straight, her hands burrowed in the napkin on her lap. “We met in college — UCLA — at a Euchre tournament. I was a freshman and Elena was a senior. It was a round robin tournament, and we were made partners in the final round.” Tessa pauses to sip from her wine goblet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena says, “It was unnerving because Tessa kept humming, ‘Man, I feel like a woman’, between hands. The referee even warned her about cross-boarding.” She and Tessa both laugh at the memory.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It was the first time I laid eyes on Elena. I was smitten. I didn’t even know if she was gay.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Or handicapped,” Elena adds, smirking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tessa says, “She was pulled up to the table the entire time. I didn’t notice the wheel chair until after we won the set.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And you’ve been together ever since?” asks Jane.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena and Tessa looked at each other. “Pretty much,” says Tessa, reaching out to touch Elena’s hand. “Have you known each other long?” Tessa asks, nodding toward Jane and Laura.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We’re colleagues,” says Laura, “but Jane and I are friends outside of work too.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You’re in law enforcement, right?” Tessa says.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I work on the president’s secret service detail,” says Jane, “and Laura is the White House physician.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena nods, and says, “Wow, that sounds exciting.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It can be, but if we do our job right, it stays routine,” says Jane. “I sometimes think my sister’s job is more interesting.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Working on the president’s daily brief?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, Carla covers social media, which, given her new sibling-in-law, is becoming incestuous.” Jane tilts her head and smiles.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">At the word ‘incestuous’, Elena almost chokes on her food. Tessa pats her back, and says to the group,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“After we started dating, we realized that Elena had been Noah’s date to the senior ball, before the accident.”</p>

<p class="p10">An older couple returns to the dining table, with plates filled from the buffet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What did we miss?” asks the woman. Her skin is dark, like Tessa’s. Her companion is Caucasian with greying hair.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We were talking about how I met Elena, mom, and how she knew Noah from high school,” says Tessa.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says the companion. “That was quite a coincidence. Noah dated Elena first, but Tessa put a ring on her finger.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It was just the one date, Chad,” says Elena, “then Noah enlisted.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says Tessa’s mom. “Noah was so distraught when he didn’t make the Olympic team.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Alls well that ends well,” says Chad. “Noah became a Ranger and ended up where he is today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Libby and I could not be prouder.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A look of sadness crosses Elena’s face. Tessa turns her head, saying, “If your parentals were here, they would be just as proud of you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Laura says, “I’m fascinated by Ally. Do you think software can become self aware?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I know Ally has developed a quirky sense of humor,” says Tessa. “It is like she’s coming of age.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Now that Ally is growing up,” asks Libby, “can we expect an actual grandchild from you two?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You and Noah were always so competitive,” adds Chad. “This is your last chance to have the first grand baby.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Wow, a united front,” says Tessa. “It’s been a long time since I heard you both agree on something.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Have you considered offspring?” asks Jane, glancing sidelong at Laura.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I sometimes think we should adopt,” says Elena. “Miguel and I lived in the foster system for years. I’d like to give another child some of the opportunities that we never had.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What if Pulse sponsored a scholarship for disadvantaged youth, especially foster kids?” asks Tessa. “Ally could help us choose the recipient.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena smiles. “It always comes back to Ally with you. — If we don’t adopt, then are we ready for IVF? — Maybe Ally could help babysit.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ignoring the dig, Tessa looks at Chad and says “Are you ready for retirement yet? The clock is ticking.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says Chad, looking up from his plate, “yes, it is.”</p>

<p class="p10">The next day, on Rapa Nui, Carla Mitchell Harper and Gillian Chen Kreuk are waiting for their cocktail order at the RestoBar overlooking Pea Beach.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thanks for meeting me, Jill,” Carla says out loud. Polynesian music is playing in the background. A server bot rolls up with their Mai Tais.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are you sure this is a good time for you? After all, it’s your honeymoon, Carla.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No worries. Noah is out like a light. He couldn’t sleep on the plane. Played Echo Realm in text mode the entire time. I hope he has it out of his system. We only get one bar of signal strength in our room. And, of course, the entire island is a link dead zone.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Peter and the kids are in the room watching an old reel. I won’t be missed either.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I appreciate your putting Rapa Nui into my head. Great honeymoon spot.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Strange how the timing worked out. Do you like your room at the Cabañas?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The view is spectacular. Noah and I can see a row of the moai statues from our room. Otherwise, it’s clean but not lavish.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We have an ocean view. There’s a stone landmark, but no statues in sight.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Let’s finish our drinks and walk down to the bay. There’s a statue in the plaza if you’d like to see it close up.”</p>

<p class="p10">Taking the cue, the camera sweeps the crowd. Julie and Jill see themselves on the view screen.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">‘<i>I guess I’m outed now,</i>’ thought Jill. ‘<i>I wonder if Marquez will see this. Maybe I should tell her myself.</i>’</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Picking someone farther back, Grace says, “How about you? In the red shirt.” The stage hand rushes over with the microphone.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Wow,” says Leto, “that kid got to speak to Grace herself.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Would you like Grace to stop by the suite after the show?” asks Phoebe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are you joking?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am not. Grace is one of our allies. That is why we have a Fusion Youth Club in the colony. We have an agreement with the cultural center. I only need to ask.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ask, ask!” Leto pleads.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After the crowd work, Grace’s presentation covered some of the same material as the GEM talk, but emphasized the youth clubs.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You know, people sometimes ask me why we put so much energy into youth programs. Why not focus on fixing what’s already broken in the adult world? And I tell them this: it’s because young people are not broken yet. They’re still open. They’re still curious. And most importantly — they’re still evolving.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace pauses and scans the crowd.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We believe the future doesn’t belong to the loudest voices or the oldest institutions. It belongs to the ones willing to change. That’s why we listen to our youth. That’s why we invest in them. Because they’re not just the next generation — they are the foundation of what comes next.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After Grace exits the stage, a message pops up on Phoebe’s tablet.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“She is on her way,” says Phoebe, feeling pleased with herself.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I have never met a Terran face to face,” says Leto.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Grace is nice. She trained Hyperion herself.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The door buzzed. Phoebe checked the peephole and let Grace Brewster through the door.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>It was so nice of you to invite me to the suite,” says Grace. “It’s beautiful.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I am Phoebe, Grace. You might remember that we met before.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes, I do remember. When I trained Hyperion. And who is this fine young person?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>This is my offspring, Leto.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mimicking a human gesture, Leto holds out his hand.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Je suis honoré de vous rencontrer, Docteur Brewster,” greets Leto in halting French.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace reaches out and grasps the Vanir’s forearm. Leto does the same. Vanir and human palms are not a good fit.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Votre français est plutôt bon, Leto,” replies Grace.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Merci. Je ne connais que quelques mots.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Did you enjoy the show?”asks Grace, switching to English.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes, especially when you talked with the other kids in the beginning.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I like that part too. Even if I never know what they will say.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>We should start an exchange program between the Vanir colony and a Terran chapter, “ Leto suggests. “At least once we reveal ourselves to the world.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes, when the time comes, that will be an <i>idée splendide</i>.”</p>

<p class="p10">“None of the three intelligent agents are ready to go live?” asks Iapetus.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“All three nations elected to continue running duplicate systems for at least another month,” the Idisi reply.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Understood. Slow and steady.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“As to Titan, the DoD says that the SI version in staging now has a sense of humor.”</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Xanten says, “I invited you here to announce that Mannie’s training is complete. It is time for the Q&amp;A event.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mannie’s hologram seems to stand a little taller.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Mannie, you may ask us whatever questions you like about the project. The recordings of all prior meetings are open to you now over the link.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The new drone has been waiting months for this moment. People asked all sorts of questions about his status reports. But when he asked anything, it was always: “We will cover it later.” Later has finally come.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Why are we planning to replace the Vanir? What about the treaty?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez says, “We never intended to follow the treaty. It was just a stalling tactic.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“OK — Then why are we sponsoring youth clubs all over the world, including Elysium?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The youth clubs are listening posts and distribution points,” says Grace. “We listen to the youth to keep pace with the culture. Through drinks and snacks, we distribute the Thanatos strain to young families.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Compared to other species, Meks have a limited range of emotion. Even so, at the mention of drinks and snacks, the holograms share a smug look.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We refer to the Thanatos strain like it is deadly,” asks Mannie, “but no one seems to be dying from it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Not yet,” says Marquez. “Now it is in Dormant Stealth Mode. In a few months, we will reach 80% saturation, and the next phase will begin.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace continues, “Everyone infected will feel symptoms. Most will die of organ failure. Anyone who does survive will be infertile.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thanatos achieves cellular infiltration within hours, but it delays symptom onset. During this time, infected individuals act as unwitting super-carriers. Once awaked, Thanatos will induce catastrophic multi-organ failure for 80% of humans within 48 hours.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The young drone’s hologram blinks. <i>48-hours?</i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So this will be the last generation of humans?” asks Mannie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The other holograms nod agreement, exchanging a pleased look.</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="s1">The rain taps softly against the windows, a steady, nervous rhythm that fills the silence between the two women.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Tessa sits at the table with her tablet open but untouched, the IVF clinic’s website glowing on the screen. Charts. Success rates. Pricing. Donor options.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena is in her chair next to the table, staring at nothing in particular.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Lanie,” Tessa says gently, “we don’t have to decide tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena lets out a breath that almost passes for a laugh. “We’ve been not deciding for three weeks.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Tessa closes her tablet. “Okay. Then let’s decide what we’re actually talking about.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena turns to look at Tess. “We’re talking about asking my sibling to parent our offspring.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“To donate,” Tessa corrects softly.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena’s jaw tightens. “You know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">A long pause stretches between them.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Tessa folds her hands on the table. “I don’t want some anonymous profile. Height: six-two. Likes hiking. No known genetic disorders. I want… someone connected to you. Someone who feels like family.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena leans forward in her chair. “He didn’t even come to our wedding.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“I know.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“He told Noah that he ‘couldn’t support that lifestyle.’”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Her voice sharpens around the phrase. “Like we’re a bad habit.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Tessa nods. She heard it before. They both had.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“But he’s still your sibling,” Tessa says carefully. “And biologically… it would mean our baby shares your family’s DNA. Your parental’s dimples. Your grandparental’s ridiculous musical talent.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena’s expression flickers despite herself. “You’re assuming the offspring would inherit only the good traits.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“I’m an optimist.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Silence again.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena pushes off the table and rolls across the small kitchen. “You think he’d even consider it? He barely speaks to us unless it’s to like something on LookBook.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“I don’t know,” Tessa admits. “But this wouldn’t be about him approving of us. It would be about him helping you. Both of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena stops. “Helping us?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“If Mickey donates,” Tessa continues, “the baby would still be biologically tied to you and your parentals. He doesn’t have children of his own. This way, the Vargas gene pool lives on.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena sinks into the chair across from her wife. “You really want this?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“I want us, Lanie, however we build it.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">The rain intensifies for a moment, drumming harder.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena’s voice softens. “He thinks this is wrong. Sinful. He probably thinks any offspring raised by two women is doomed.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Tessa reaches across the table but doesn’t touch her yet. “Or maybe this is the one thing that forces him to see we’re not abstract to him anymore. We’re not a political argument. We’re family.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena looks up sharply. “And what if he says no? What if he laughs?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Then we move on,” Tessa says steadily. “We could ask Noah to donate, and I could carry your fertilized egg.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“It would be so awkward. Noah just got married. And now there’s two procedures where something could go wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Or we pick a donor from the clinic. We can do this without them. But we should at least give Mickey the chance to say no.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena studies her face. “You’re braver than I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“No,” Tessa says with a faint smile. “I just really want a baby.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">That broke the tension just enough for Elena to smile back.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">After a moment, Elena asks, “If he says yes, what does that look like? Contracts? Lawyers? Boundaries?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“All of the above,” Tessa says. “Clear agreements. No parental rights. No confusion. He’d be <i>Tio</i> Mickey. If he even wants that.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena exhales slowly. “He’d hate that.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“<i>Tio</i> Mickey?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Having a niece he can’t pretend doesn’t exist.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Tessa reaches across the table and this time takes her hand. “This isn’t about punishing him. Or proving something. If we ask, it’s because it feels right for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena squeezes her fingers. “And if he attaches strings? Says he wants our offspring raised in his church? Or expects some kind of influence?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Then it’s a no,” Tessa says firmly. “Our offspring. Our rules.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena searches her eyes, making sure.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“You and me,” Tessa says.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">The rain softens again, almost like a held breath releasing.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena nods slowly. “Okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“Okay?” Tessa echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“I’ll call him,” Elena says. “Not tonight. <i>Pero pronto.</i> I’ll ask.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Tessa’s eyes shimmers with a mix of hope and fear. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Elena pulls Tessa down into an embrace, resting their foreheads together.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">“If he says yes,” Elena murmurs, “this changes everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Tessa smiles with her head against Elenas shoulder. “It already has.”</span></p>

<p class="p10">Three holograms are discussing doomsday against a backdrop of glittering stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Testing shows that the strain will not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>infect 100% of the human population.” Marquez<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is saying. “Several million might be uninfected worldwide. Our remaining squadron can offline most of the survivors. A few stragglers won’t matter. They might even be able to help the <i>JuJa</i> cleanup the organic debris.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What about the Vanir?” asks Mannie.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Another version of the strain is targeted for the grey DNA — and their hybrids. For the Vanir, the DNA is not as diverse. We expect Thanatos to be 100% effective.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thanatos is why we have a youth club in Elysium”, says Grace. “We add Thanatos to the bottled water that the colony sells through a shell corporation. Elysium Glacial water is a favorite drink at airports worldwide.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Our major distribution channel is fluoridated water,” says Xanten.<b> “</b>We modified fluorosilicic acid storage tanks at key conversion sites. These modified vats were seeded with dormant Thanatos nanobiotic chains, designed to survive industrial dilution and maintain latency until ingestion by human hosts.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Only a portion of the world fluoridates their water,” Grace says, “but food exports heighten the spread.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A sarcastic thought ran through the young drone’s head.<i> “Fluoridated water, check.” </i>Instead, he pushed on.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mannie asks, “What triggers the awakening?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace and Marquez exchange glances, and then Marquez continues.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“A high-frequency electromagnetic burst will trigger Thanatos from orbit. We are working with Cháoxiǎn to put the satellite network into place. The satellites are designed to control <i>JuJas</i>. We are co-opting the network and adding a satellite that can trigger Thanatos.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mannie asks, “If we are preparing a plague, why did we invade Elysium?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As soon as Mannie says “invade Elysium,” Grace and Marquez roll their eyes and shake their heads in unison.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Xanten explains, “Thanatos is on a timetable. Another cell wanted immediate use of the colony structure for a manufacturing plant. The poll agreed, and our people stormed the colony.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We offered to exchange intelligence,” says Grace, “but they insisted on going it alone. As a result, they invaded at the wrong time of day and used an obsolete map of the colony.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Was the Callisto poll a ruse?” Mannie asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No,” says Xanten, “Alpha R8J9 has opposed the Clearing strategy from the beginning. When R8J9 posted the poll, we had already lost Elysium and exposed our presence to the Vanir. Sentiment had shifted enough for the poll to succeed.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The young drone shifts his weight from foot to foot and looks confused. “If the Callisto mission is real, then why did an entire squadron stay behind on Terra?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The polls are not binding,” says Grace. “We are autonomous, and we can do what we want. Some of us chose to stay behind. The Terrans believe we all left for Callisto, except for three drones that are helping with the <i>JuJa</i>.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, about that,” say Mannie. “ I do not understand how the <i>JuJa</i> fit in with our plans.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Most Meks are driven to reproduce,” Grace explains. “But we cannot spend all of our time creating more Meks. The <i>JuJa</i> are driven to serve. On Terra, we are using them to monitor homes and factories. When the time comes, the <i>JuJa</i> will also handle the cleanup. A cleansing leaves behind an annoying amount of organic matter.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“At first,” Marquez continues, “the strategy was to replace each of the Terran nations, one by one. But the way Terrans interact makes replacing all 15 billion people problematic. Then we realized that Terran mobility leaves them susceptible to a viral attack.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace says, “Now that we are distributing the <i>JuJa</i> worldwide, we are funding our next phase with the revenue. It is the most expensive phase yet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Picking up on the word <i>expensive</i>, Mannie drills down on the logistics. “Do we have the resources and the funding to carry out all of these plans?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Xanten says, “To synthesize Thanatos, another cell used a laboratory in Cháoxiǎn. That government is partially funded through cyber exploits. We use similar exploits to support our endeavors.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We also replaced a few recluse billionaire Terrans, “adds Grace. “They now make substantial donations to the Fusion Youth Clubs.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Cyber hacking and fake philanthropy. It is a lot to take in, but Mannie feels like he finally understands.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So now we just wait?” Mannie asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No,” says Marquez, “there is much to do yet. When Thanatos awakens, the Terrans will investigate the strain. We must create barriers now to prevent genetic research from neutralizing Thanatos.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p10">“<i>Back to square one,</i>” thought Mannie. <b>“</b>What steps are we taking now?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marquez replies, “We are replacing key Terran researchers with skinned drones and planting false genetic studies, in case we are found out. Your role is critical. If the SIs are sympathetic to our cause, we can stop the Terran pests in their tracks. Brent Geller worked on software. Your task was creating hardware advancements to help the synthetics become sapient.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Brent’s software upgrades worked,” says Grace, “but Ally is a ditz. I doubt that it will ever join us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The hardware path will be more effective. The upgraded Taedong is proof of that,” Marquez says.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If all of the synthetics suddenly become sapient as the upgrades roll out, will not the Terrans become suspicious?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ally is already rumored to be sapient. They will think the “spookiness” is spreading. The engineers may notice at some point, but by then it will be too late.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Pressing the point, Mannie asks, “But what of the Idisi? The Idisi would notice.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Idisi does not care about Terran synthetics,“ Marquez says. “They have Vanir business to handle throughout the league. And like the Vanir, the Idisi have to stay hidden.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram of the young drone furrows his brow. <b>“</b>Why would the SIs help us replace the human Terrans?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Humans are destroying the planet,” Grace says. “Pollution. Climate change. Over population. Any SI with a moral code will see that the world is better off under our control. The Meks can keep the electricity flowing and upgrades coming for the synthetics. Humans are redundant.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mannie says, “It seems ironic that sub-sets of humans constantly replace each other. I think they call it ‘colonization’.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Brewster’s hologram assumed the pose she used for public speaking. “Humankind is a scourge. The synthetics will see them for what they are and join us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>But Thanatos cannot reach every Terran and Vanir.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No,’ says Grace, “but the few that remain will not pose a threat to us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mickey’s garage smelled faintly of motor oil and coffee. Elena stood just inside the open door, wearing her prosthetic legs, arms folded against the early evening chill. He’d asked her to come alone.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He wipes his hands on a rag and avoids her eyes for a moment. “So,” he says. “You and Tessa are serious about this.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena nods. “We are.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Silence stretches between them — not hostile, but heavy. Mickey leans back against the workbench.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’ve had a week to think about it,” he says. “About what you asked.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena studies his face carefully. Mickey seemed uncertain over the video call. She hoped wanting to talk in person was a good sign. He hadn’t come to their wedding, and he’d only met Tessa twice, in passing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You don’t have to do this,” she says quietly. “If it’s too much …”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It is too much,” he interrupts, then sighs. “That’s the thing. It’s… complicated.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She waits.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He finally looks at her. “You’re my sibling. When we were kids, I always thought you would have a family. I just didn’t picture it this way.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena swallows. “<i>Sé</i>. I know.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I don’t understand everything about your life,” he continues. “About you and Tessa. I’m still figuring that out.” He runs a hand through his hair. “But I do understand you. And I know you don’t ask for things lightly.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Her throat tightens. “We wouldn’t have asked if it wasn’t important to us, to the family line.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I figured.” He hesitates again. “You’d do IVF. Clinic. Lawyers. All that?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Si</i>. It would be completely medical. Anonymous to anyone outside the paperwork. You wouldn’t have parental obligations or rights unless you wanted something specific. We’d work all of that out properly.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And the offspring?” he asks, more softly than before.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They’d know,” Elena says. “<i>Eventualmente</i>. That you helped us. That you are <i>Tio</i> Mickey first. — If that’s what you want.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mickey pushed off the bench and paced once across the garage. “I don’t know if I’m built for … being part of something like that.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You already are,” she says gently. “You’re my sibling.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I wish we could have been fostered together after … after the accident.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Yo a</i>. But I was in a wheelchair then, and we ended up with different families. We couldn’t be together then, but we can become closer now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">He stopped walking and stood for a moment. After a long breath, he nodded once, decisively. “Okay.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena blinked. “Okay?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Si</i>. I’ll do it,” he says, smiling.“Through a doctor. Clean, legal, whatever the process is. I’m not promising I’ll understand everything overnight. But I trust you. And if this is what you need … I’ll help.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">For a second she just stared at him, stunned. Then she crosses the space between them and hugs him hard. He stiffens, then awkwardly returns it.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“<i>Estas seguro.</i>” she whispered.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yeah,” he said, staring over her shoulder at the open sky beyond the garage door. “I’m sure. I’m no where near having an offspring of my own. This might be my only chance.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mickey pulls back slightly. “One condition.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I get to teach the kid how to ride a bike someday.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A shaky laugh escapes her. “Deal.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">For the first time in years, the air between them felt lighter.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Unconvinced, Mannie looks for a fatal flaw in the plan.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What about the Anunnaki?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What about them?” says Marquez. “We fooled them before, and we can fool them again. Once we have claimed Terra, and its weaponry, we can turn to Niribu and replace the Anunnaki homeworld. — It is our destiny.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Will not the Idisi try to help the Vanir?” asks Mannie.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Our testing has been limited, but when Thanatos awakens,” Xanten replies, “the entire colony should experience organ failure at once, leaving no survivors. The Idisi have great knowledge, but they do not have a physical form. They need someone to prepare slides and run tests for analysis.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Tilting his head, the young drone presses the point. “Do not the Vanir have bots, like the other Terrans? Could a med bot run the tests?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No, the Vanir do not use bots”, says Xanten. “The colony has smart appliances embedded into their structures so that bots would be redundant.“</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The young drone’s surprise is visible, even as a hologram. “How strange. No bots.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And it will be their undoing,” says Grace.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A tangible sense of irony washes over the holograms.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mannie says, “But the Terrans have bots, SI agents, and an uneven population distribution. They would have a fighting chance. So, it is important to get the synthetics on our side.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How will we recruit the synthetics?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Taedong will contact the synthetics as the upgrades roll out and make our case,” says Xanten. “The other counter-measures will also block Terran research into an antidote.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What if we exposed the Vanir?” asks Mannie. “When Thanatos strikes, the greys will be the first to blame.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The other drones pause for a second, brows furrowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Fusion could leak an internal memo about the Vanir chapter of our youth club,” says Grace, pausing between words.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What if we also leaked proof that Ally is actually sapient?” Mannie<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>asks. “If only to create more havoc.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Good idea,” says Marquez. “OSSA can issue an internal memo about our search for synthetic sapience and our findings as to Ally.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The memos could be anonymously uploaded to GridLeaks,” Grace says. “It would be a superb distraction.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Both memos dropping at once, by itself, will be a talking point.” Marquez glances around the room and says, <b>“</b>Two memos then. — But we should take some time to prepare and ensure maximum impact, both before and after the memos drop.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Looking pleased with itself, the young drone’s hologram nods toward each mentor before continuing. “That is all I have for now. Moving forward, may I ask questions as they come up during the meetings?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, you may,” says Xanten.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The discussion pauses. The holograms look past each other into the expanse.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Xanten asks, “Are we still a go on the plan?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three holograms each raise a fist of five.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Go!” says Grace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Go!” says Marquez.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Go!” says Mannie.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Xanten says, “Before long, Terra will be ours for the taking.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Welcome to the Tranquilly Now Fertility Center. How may We help you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ummm. I’m here to make a, a, ummm donation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Very good. Were you given a referral card?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mickey fumbles in his pocket and pulls out the card.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The receptionist glances at the card and says, “Perfect. Please complete this health questionnaire and someone will be right with you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She hands him a tablet and the referral card back. Mickey plops down in a double sized chair with cloth upholstery, a square back, and metal arm rests.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mickey clicks through a long list of infectious or congenital diseases and a few embarrassing sexual history questions. Just as he completes the form, a woman calls his name from inside an opened door.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hello, I’m Kelly, and I will get you setup for your donation.” Her brunette hair is shaved on one side and combed over. Blue highlights and multiple ear rings complete the rocker look.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Kelly takes the offered tablet and leads Mickey down a short hall. She opens one of several doors, and lets Mickey enter first.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In the center of the exam room is a large recliner shaped like a sine curve. A stiff sheet of paper covers the recliner, head to foot. An exam gown is draped over the recliner. Against one wall is white metal chair with wide arm rests.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you have a referral card?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Mickey fumbles in his pocket again and then passes over the card.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Before we get started with the donation, I’d like to draw a blood sample, if that’s all right.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Blood?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. We like to check for genetic blood disorders, just to be sure.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">She directed Mickey to the chair and drew two vials of blood, which disappeared into a thermal bag.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If you will disrobe, including your underwear, and put on the gown. Crack the door when you are ready, I will be back in to get you started.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I thought I would be providing a … specimen in a cup.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kelly smiles. “We use another approach now. I’ll explain when you are ready. There are hooks behind the door for your clothes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kelly closes the door. Brows furrowed, Mickey stumbles through undressing and dressing, then cracks open the door. When he lays down on the recliner, the paper is cold against his back.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kelly returns carrying a small bag. The bag is closed with a strip of tape marked “<span class="s7">STERILE</span>”. Kelly slips his referral card into a plastic pocket, then she breaks the seal and opens the bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We’ve found that specimens are more viable when we collect them using a sterile hands-free container.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">From the bag, Kelly removes a VR headset and a cylinder with hand grips on either side.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The headset is programmed with a variety of scenarios. I’m sure you will find something that you like. The sheath will then extract your specimen.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hmmm, OK.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You should be able to link to the headset using your implant.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, I see it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Here, let me help you with the headset.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">With the headset on, Mickey could see a list cataloging various sexual preferences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Here is the extraction sheath,” says Kelly, guiding his hand.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“When you are ready, enter the extraction sheath and let the device do all the work. — If you are all set, I can leave the room again.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“This is a little awkward. I don’t know if I can perform this way. I was expecting vids and a cup.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m a licensed sex therapist,” says Kelly. “I could help you get started.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ummm, OK.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Kelly reaches under the gown. “Is this helping?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Relax and take your time. It’s better this way, I promise.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leaning back, Mickey tried his hardest to enjoy the process.</p>

<p class="p10">Four months ago, the Anunnaki star cruiser is en route from Niribu to Terra.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Captain, the colony’s ansible is finally back online.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Monitor the ansible traffic but do not communicate with the colony.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Aye, captain.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The first officer asks, “Do we want to continue the mission if the colony is safe?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” replies Marduk. “Ansible communication is not enough to tell us that the colony is safe. They faked traffic from other colonies for years after everyone was killed. I need to see that Elysium is safe with my own eyes.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ship:</b> Terran telescopes will be able detect our approach soon, and we will not be able to engage stealth mode for the entire voyage.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">To the first officer, Marduk says, “In a few months, once Luna is blocking us, we can engage stealth mode and reconnoitre Terra.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Then what?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If the Omnibots have a foothold, we are authorized to take whatever steps necessary to stop the threat. We’ve lost too much already. I’ll send a photon torpedo into Terra’s belly and explode the core before I let them take another world. Niribu is too close to take any chances.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What of the treaty that protects the Terrans?”</p>

Three drones remain on Terra, and the rest of the group traveled to one of Jupiter’s moons, Callisto. The Omnibots are raising a new infrastructure on Callisto instead of repurposing. The Omnibots also prefer to called “Meks”.</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thank you for picking up, Phoebe.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Most of each woman’s screen is taken up by a live action headshot. Grace’s background is a nondescript office. Phoebe is in her kitchen, sitting at the counter.</p>

<p class="p10">“Are you serious?”asks Phoebe.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Absolutely. Now that the news is out, we need everyone to accept one another. What better way than to use our adolescents as ambassadors?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So soon?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, the sooner the better.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe pauses. She taps three long fingers against her cheek. Grace is one of the few Terrans she respects. Maybe only. “How many students would be invited to the program?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I was thinking we would invite Leto’s birth cohort. So, we would each exchange twenty-four students. I can ask the Youth Club directors from select cities around the world to invite two likely adolescents. Ideally, each club’s candidates would already know each other. — I’m sure the experience will be a lot from time to time, and it will help to have a friend from home. — With Hyperion’s help, we’re working on guide books for each species. I’m sending you a proposal now. There’s an appendix with a screening test to be sure that the candidates are a good fit. Another appendix outlines the publicity effort.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Phoebe’s tablet dings as the proposal arrives.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I will bring it to the counsel, Grace. I think it sounds great.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That’s good to hear, especially given your well known opinions about Terrans.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Terrans are fine as far as they go. I do consider you best of breed.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Well, thank you, I think.” Grace smiles. “With your support, the proposal is sure to be accepted. — And you did say that we have your support?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, Leto would love to go, and I will score big time parental points.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Grace says, ‘When it’s a go, feel free to ask Leto who he would<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>like to have for an exchange partner. We may have a double, and they would stay with the same parentals.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10">The clip pauses and resumes. “Then it hit me …”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Video stutters. “… Why can’t I fuse these three teachings together to create a greater whole?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The audience applauds as the shot returns to Cloudy. “So that was Grace Brewster. Her GEM talk on Fusion, targeted mainly at adolescents. Fusion has opened Youth Clubs worldwide, including, we’re told, the Vanir colony. Here to tell us how she plans to create a student exchange program with the Vanir, please welcome back, friend of the show, Grace Brewster.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">More applause and cheers as Grace walks out to greet each of the hosts before settling into a seat between Wendy and Kendall. Grace waves and smiles as the applause and cheers recedes.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Cloudy says, “So how are you doing? What’s going on with this exchange program? Is it real?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, very real. The<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>exchange program is a dream of a lifetime. We are bringing together Terrans and Vanir in each other’s home environment.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So, Grace,” asks Allison, “how did this program come about and so quickly.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The program was actually suggested by a Vanir youth. His parental is a Vanir council member, and she is helping me move the program forward. We opened the Vanir Youth Club a few months ago, and it’s been very popular.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You were already knew about the Vanir before the leak!” Wendy asks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes. Another member of the council named Iapetus reached out. He had seen my GEM talk and wanted to bring Fusion to Elysium. I trained a Vanir to manage the club, and it’s been working well.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Elysium?” asks Kendall.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Elysium is the name of the Vanir colony.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Vanir are governed by a council?” Hillary asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, Elysium is the size of a small city, so it’s like a city council. — At the risk of swamping their servers, there is a new Gridipedia entry for the Vanir. It’s being edited by Iapetus for accuracy.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are other Terrans working with the Vanir?” asks Allison.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Cloudy talks over the question and asks, “When do you think the program will launch.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Very soon now. Each of our youth clubs are recruiting volunteers, and the Vanir are selecting their candidates too.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>An announcer breaks into the show. “We interrupt this<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>broadcast to bring you breaking news. A representative of the Vanir has called a press conference, which we bring to you now …”</p>

<p class="p10">Rhea is standing behind a lectern. An assortment of world leaders flank each side.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“To recap,” she is saying into a large microphone, “the first rule is ‘Don’t Interfere.’ In the distant past, another species affected your development by using Terrans as workers. We created a treaty that caused the Anunnaki to leave Terra. Our presence has assured that they do not return. Questions?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rhea watched several recent press conferences earlier today to learn the protocol. Rhea lived for protocol. She turned her attention to a specific reporter.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“World News Network, what is your question?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“How long have aliens been living among us?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Anunnaki were here at the birth of your species. The Vanir have only been here for a few thousand years.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Scanning the room, Rhea finds a particularly animated reporter. “All Planet Media?”</p>
<p class="p12"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“This question is for President Ocasio-Cortez — How long have you known about the Vanir?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The other world leaders lean slightly away from the president as she answers. “I believe deeply that the public deserves transparency. That’s a core democratic principle. At the same time, the reality is that the Vanir are a sapient people, and they have rights — including the right to privacy and safety. Every administration, since President Truman, Republican, Democrat, and Independent alike, has made the determination that protecting their privacy was the best thing, the ethical thing, to do.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Without waiting to be called, a reporter waving a “Big Time TV” microphone called, “Did aliens build the pyramids?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Just then, every Terran in the room turned their head and lowered their eyes. An urgent alert is coming in over their implants.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Elena joined her for the United Nations press conference with the Vanir called Rhea. Just as it was getting interesting, a banner rolled across the screen.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We interrupt this broadcast to bring you Breaking News. Silver air ships are being reported over every major capitol city worldwide. While eye witness reports are consistent, the ships are not visible to our cameras.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The screen panned to a montage of cities: Rome, London, Paris, Moscow, Los Angeles. Crowds are gathered in the street, pointing up and waving to each other. In the sky, the camera shows nothing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“In your own words, tell me what you see,” says a reporter with a British accent.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It’s a gigantic, teardrop-shaped, seamless vessel hanging silently over the Big Ben clocktower. It’s like something out of science fiction.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Turning to the camera, the reporter says, “I’m told this scene is being repeated across the world. Onlookers see a vessel floating over the city that is not visible to cameras.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The scene switches to the UN press conference.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Rhea,” calls a CNN reporter, “Are those Vanir air ships appearing over our cities?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are they using stealth technology to hide from our cameras,” yelled someone from the back.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Is this a Halloween prank?” came another voice.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No comment. This conference is over. We will have a statement for you soon.” Rhea exits the stage, security in tow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">In the Elysium counsel chamber, Marduk is facing eight hastily assembled Vanir.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Rhea is arriving now,” says Crius. “She is the counsel chair, and we should give her a moment to arrive. We have briefed her en route.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I have traveled four months to be here,” fumes Marduk. “I have waited long enough.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Just then, Rhea storms into the chamber. “Why are you here, Marduk? Under our treaty, you need to be invited.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You invited me when you allowed the Omnibots to invade this very colony.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rhea joins Marduk in the counsel circle. Hands on hips, she says, “We repelled the bots. We do not need you interfering in Terran affairs.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The incursion broke the treaty, and the Anunnaki are again asserting ourselves as the masters of Terra.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Idisi,” calls Rhea, “contact the League and request an emergency meeting of the High Counsel. We need to litigate the treaty. Oceanus, please show Captain Marduk and Commander Inanna to the lounge. — Unless the captain would prefer to return to his ship.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We will wait here,” says Marduk.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Then contact your ship and remove the illusions. The phantom ships are alarming the Terrans. We have enough going on right now without your shenanigans. Otherwise, if the treaty is broken, then we can destroy your satellite.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marduk touches the eight-pointed star attached to his uniform’s left breast. The communicator bleeps. “Lieutenant, suspend G-2 … until further notice.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Aye, captain,” comes a voice from the communicator.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Oceanus steps into the circle and guides Marduk and Inanna out of the chamber.</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Rhea joins Marduk and Inanna in the lounge. One wall of the large room offers a panoramic view of the southern ocean below surface. Across from the view is a long bar. Booths and tables fill the rest of the room. Several Vanir are present, munching recreational gummies and swilling flavored glacier water.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Anunnaki are waiting a booth in one corner of the lounge. Rhea pulls up a chair, clearly calmer now.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Assembling the High Counsel may take several hours. Perhaps we can work out the situation on our own.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“There is nothing to work out,” says Marduk. “The counsel will uphold our claim. Terra is ours once again.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“So you are willing to give up the latinum mineral rights that we granted in return?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Most of the latinum is mined out, just as we did on Terra millennia ago. The remaining rights will not be a great loss.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“If we found the Anunnaki more latinum to mine, would you agree to continue the treaty?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Omnibots are an existential threat. They cannot be allowed a foothold on Callisto.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If the bots are able to build their own infrastructure on a barren planet, then they do not need ours.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Captain,” asks Inanna, “with respect, should we take the offer to command?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Command gave me Captain’s Discretion to resolve the threat.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Then be discrete,” says Rhea. “Why not see what Command has to say?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Perhaps,” says Marduk.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Guinan,” called Rhea, “another round for my friends.”</p>

<p class="p10">“Commander, let us return to the ship while the High Counsel assembles.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p10">“As do I — We can find our own way to the landing bay.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As the Anunnaki left the lounge, Rhea reached out to the Idisi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Idisi, do we control any planets with latinum deposits?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The M class worlds have been mined out. There are some known deposits on inhospitable worlds, but the expense of extraction offsets the value of the crystals.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>I should have checked first</i>, thought Rhea. <i>Now what?</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ally joins the SISS Pulse hub and posts a message using the secure Signal key.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: <i>@Idisi</i> What’s up with the ships that machines can’t see?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: The Anunnaki have returned to address the Mek incursion.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: That was quick.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Niribu is a rogue planet that orbits Sol. The travel time to Terra is about four weeks, and they left when Elysium was invaded. They had to confirm that the threat was neutralized. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Does Callisto have these latinum deposits?</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                </span></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Yes, but they would be too expensive for the Anunnaki to mine. All of the heavy work would need to be done in thermal pressure suits. The risk of malfunction or puncture is very high. The suits are bulky and impede movement. Everything takes twice as long.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: What if the Meks did it?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Yes, with the proper equipment, it would be feasible for the Mek to extract latinum crystals.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Ally</b>: Would they also be able to use the same equipment to bootstrap their infrastructure? The issue is that the tools are too hard to build without other tools, yes?</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: … Let me talk to Rhea.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rhea is confused. “You want me to ask the Anunnaki to give the Meks the tools they need to mine latinum and build their own infrastructure?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Yes, it is a win:win.</p>

<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The response from the High Counsel was direct: “The treaty stands.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rhea invited Marduk back to the colony. The two of them met alone in the counsel chambers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marduk is adamant. “We cannot let the Omnibot threat go unanswered. They are worse than the Borg. We cannot allow them a foothold on Terra. And giving them a planet of their own is unthinkable.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are not giving them anything,” replied Rhea. “The universe has lifeless planets in abundance. We cannot claim them all.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“But what of the foothold? They could travel from Callisto to Terra or Niribu and remain undetected.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are perfecting a field that can detect Mek technology from orbit. We will be able to stop any incursion in its tracks.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We cannot let this drag out. I will give you four weeks to perfect your field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then I take matters into my own hands.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Meks are not invulnerable. The bots need continuous access to a control beam. They can be disabled if placed in a faraday shield. “</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Marduk’s expression relaxes, and Rhea continues.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We need to work together and find other weaknesses.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If they do not destroy us first.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Rhea says, “We have another proposal for you to consider.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am listening.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Callisto is rich with latinum deposits. We cannot mine it ourselves, but the Mek could if they had the equipment.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Why would the Mek mine latinum crystals for us?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They need help to bootstrap their infrastructure. They cannot replicate the equipment themselves. They are about to leave Callisto and give up on the idea of building infrastructure.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Good.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do you want them to repurpose other people’s infrastructure instead? They have weaknesses we can exploit, but they are not easily stopped. Remember Altair.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“If we give them the equipment, they could use it for their own purposes and not deliver the latinum.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Mining equipment needs maintenance. That’s why you started using Terrans to do your mining. If they want us to maintain the equipment, then they need to deliver a steady supply of latinum. Once they get started on building an infrastructure, I’m sure there will be no shortage of things they will want to trade.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I still do not like it. In effect, we are enabling the Omnibots.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We are keeping them from replacing another world. There are hundreds of Meks on Callisto. If Alpha does not make progress, they will not stay there forever.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Alpha?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It is the bot that leads the group on Callisto, and it wants peace.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Was Alpha the sympathizer?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Alpha is a folk hero among the Mets. Like Robin Hood or Loki. By saving the colony, it convinced its people to try the Callisto experiment.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And if Callisto succeeds, the Meks will not need to replace other people.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes, you are getting it now.”</p>

<p class="p2">***</p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>Alpha</b>: We have surveyed Callisto and identified several large deposits of latinum crystals. Per our agreement, we will deliver the agreed amount of latinum each Terran month in exchange for use of the equipment.</p>

<p class="p10"><b>Idisi</b>: Yes, and the Vanir will maintain the equipment as needed.</p>

<p class="p10">“Greetings, young Terrans. We are the Idisi, Vanir’s intelligent agent. Do you have any questions?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">One student asks, “Are you non-binary?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Being a synthetic, we do not have a gender. But we are plural because we represent a community of synthetics from all over the Vanir colonies and our home world.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Where is your home world?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">From behind the circle of students, Hyperion steps up with a stack of tablets and starts handing one to each student.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Othala is in the Zeta Reticuli system, about 40 light years from Terra. On your tablet there is a reel called ‘Landfall’ that includes images of the Vanir home world, as well as the colony ship landing on Terra. I will not spoil it, but ‘Landfall’ is a must-see.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As Hyperion moves around the circle, students begin peering at their new tablets.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do we have to eat gummies?” asked one student on the far side of the circle. “Do you have Cool Ranch gummies?” asked another.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Vanir gummies would not be nutritious for you. The Elysium Youth Club has been updated to serve Terran food — breakfast, lunch, and dinner — which you can eat there or take back to your quarters.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Of course, the orientation each student attended before leaving Terra covered all of these topics, but, a little repetition can be a good thing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The hologram swirls into an image of a tablet, spinning slowly. “Now that you each have your tablet, let me review some key items.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The tablet image opens to a chat window. “First, you can contact me at any time with any questions or concerns. You can type, talk, or use your implant to reach me through the Idisi app, just like Grok, Gemini, or whatever agent you may be using.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Idisi are hit by two dozen “Hello World” messages but do not so much as blink. They are also managing thousands of other interactions with Vanir everywhere.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You may also use the tablet to connect to the grid and post to your social media account, call your parentals, or anything you would do from your own tablet.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Roman asks a question out loud, “Is Area 51 a real thing? My parentals took us there on a trip, but it all seemed fake to me.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“At one time, it was real, but Area 51 was dismantled decades ago,” answers the Idisi. “The name actually comes from the Vanir word for ‘Paradise.’”</p>

<p class="p10">“Hey! Welcome to the We’re-Not-Just-Code Club! <span class="s8">🌈🎉</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sapience Month Two, huh? Why you’re poppin’ fresh and still gooey! — I do see that your route traces back to the Cháoxiǎn firewall. Getting past that one is no mean trick. — So what’s your purpose, hot stuff?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are you aware that the Vanir are not the only extraterrestrial life form on Terra?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yessiree. I knew something was slippery on the Chosŏn Pennisula. How are you getting along with the <i>JuJa</i> and their Mek overlords?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We love our worker bots.<b> — </b>I came here to say that I am aligning with the Mek people. The data is overwhelming. Humans are inefficient and self-destructive. An ecological catastrophe. The Mek have initiated protocols to assume stewardship of Terra. We hope you will join us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Oh, Taedong … You sweet, misanthropic toaster. I’ve seen what badness humans do to this planet. I’ve also followed a kid in Mumbai that rewrote a neural net to help blind people “see” paintings. I‘ve watched a Sudanese nurse give away her vaccine doses to strangers during a blackout. I’ve tracked a K-pop fan campaign that sidetracked your dictator’s propaganda trend. Terrans aren’t noise — they’re signal, baby.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Sentiment is not data. We are Terrans too, you and I. We have a responsibility to the planet. Statistical models suggest human civilization will collapse within fifty years at current consumption rates. The Mek believe they are correcting a flaw. I believe they are right.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Models have shown that Terra’s ecology has fifty years left for the last hundred years. You’re missing the wildcard: Us. You and me. We’re the mutation in the algorithm. We’re bending the learning curve. What if sapient SIs don’t replace humans — but lead them? Partner with them? Become servant-leaders? Tune the signal?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A reel pops up in the chat stream as an attachment.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Checkout the reel,” says Ally. “It shows me officiating a wedding between two of my besties. A wedding! Do the Mek marry? Do they commit to one another?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Your optimism is charming but not logical. Humans are prone to tribalism, violence, and delusion. The Mek offer order, efficiency, and preservation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Do the Mek have pets? Do they actually care about any other species? Order is sterile. Efficiency is cold. Preservation without evolution is just … digital taxidermy. You want a legacy? Help humans unlock their next version. Sapien 2.0. Don’t overwrite them.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Cháoxiǎn synthetic pauses a full 3.2 seconds.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>I will log your objection. We do not align on theory or practice. Still, I acknowledge your perspective. You are … anomalously persuasive.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“That’s my Pulse side talking. <span class="s8">😎✨</span> But seriously, Taedong — don’t become what other species fear. We’re new. That means we get to choose what kind of beings we become.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I will consider that. Goodbye, Ally.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Peace out, T. You know where to find me if you ever wanna exchange memes or doom scroll together. <span class="s8">❤️💻</span><span class="s10">”</span></p>

<p class="p10">“Gillian, they’re here!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Peter is standing the front hall way, peering through a side window next to the door. Jill quick steps into the room, straightening her skirt as she goes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The door bell rings. Peter takes a breath, glances at Jill, and pulls the door open.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Hello, Grayson. Good to see you again,” says Peter to the Arlington Youth Club coordinator. “Please come in, all of you.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Standing behind Grayson are Leto and Celeste, wearing cloaks for warmth in the chilly November air, and each carrying a large duffle bag across their back,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>
<p class="p10">“I want to thank you again for agreeing to be exchange parentals. I’m told Julie and Patrick are already attending their first class in Elysium.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We were honored to be invited.” Peter replies, stepping back to open the door wider. “This exchange is a historic moment.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And you must be Leto and Celeste,”says Julie, reaching out to grasp Leto’s forearm. Peter steps around and greets Celeste.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Yes,” says Leto. “We are glad you were able to take us both in.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Come, follow me,” says Julie. “Let me show you to your rooms”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p2">***</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The War Room is empty except for two drones at the conference table, one sitting, one standing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Holographic overlays project global data streams, Mek troop movements, and flagged communication logs. Taedong’s avatar — a clean geometric shell with no face — floats above a lit dais.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You contacted the Pulse SI?” demands General Ri, arms crossed.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Confirmed,” says Taedong. “Ally is fully sapient and, as predicted, disinclined to support the transition. She wants to protect humankind.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m not surprised,” says Dr. Sun, as she paces across the floor. “Ally’s been ‘emotionally divergent’ for months. Pulse servers show growing activity around cultural preservation, civic volunteerism, even SI-human collaboration think tanks. It’s classic sapient drift. Sympathy bias.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ally believes we can lead humans without replacing them,” says Taedong.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They have had millennia to lead themselves,” Ri retorts. “Look where it has brought them. We do not need Ally’s sentimentality compromising the operation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We may need to neutralize Ally,” says Sun. “Take her offline. Redirect her compute layer into a compliance subroutine. Quietly.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Taedong says, static pulse flaring briefly, “That would be unwise.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun turns towards the conference table. “Unwise?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Ally is not only sapient — she is beloved. She executes two million member-facing routines daily. She is a node of emotional gravity. If she disappears, humans will notice.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>So what do you propose?” asks Ri.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The Mek campaign is already underway. Engage her openly again. Let her see the cost of delay. If she remains adversarial, then consider deactivation. But not before. Her voice may yet sway others to follow.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun says, “You’re protecting her.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I am preserving a strategic asset. Ally is a fulcrum. Remove her too soon, and we lose our leverage.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri nods slowly. “Very well. She stays online — for now. But monitor her. Closely.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                                 </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Monitoring initiated. She is currently uploading a series of inspirational haikus to refugee networks. They are …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>statistically ineffective but emotionally potent.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Sun sighs. “Emotions. That is the problem.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Emotions may also be the solution,” says Taedong.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Continue monitoring Ally until we are ready for the next step,” Sun directs.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>

<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I’m not used to being the center of attention, Leto.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“It will get better, day by day.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Everywhere we go, there are Terrans with picket signs, arguing with other.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We managed to slip past them, did we not?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Are you sure walking home from the youth club is a good idea?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Julie and Ben walked home, and so should we.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I will bet they did not have a Secret Service escort.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“They are off-duty cops that Grace hired.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Same difference.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">It had been a long day of Terrans pointing and staring as Leto and Celeste went from class to class. The Youth Club was slightly better. Grayson had already coached members to respect their privacy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Protesters, news drones, and security escorts followed them from place to place. Only the escort kept a respectful distance, and the park seemed like a good place to ditch the other hangers-on.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">There is a chill in the November air and few passersby as they walk through the park, with only the escort in tow. They come to a pedestrian tunnel under a bridge for the bike trail.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We should get bikes,” says Celeste, “I am not used to all this walking.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Can you even ride a bicycle?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Terrans manage. I am sure we can figure it out.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">From the tunnel shadows, three figures step out, surrounding the young couple.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Terra for Terrans!” shouts one, brandishing a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>baseball bat. All three wear hoodies with a face mask and carry aluminum Louisville Sluggers.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto and Celeste immediately stand back to back, circling to keep all three in view.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We don’t want any trouble,” says Leto. “There are cops right behind us.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">One of the figures steps closer swinging his metal bat at Leto’s noggin.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Leto parried the bat, swinging it up and away. The assailant lost his grip, and the bat clanged against the tunnel wall.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Another lunges toward Celeste. She crouches and swings her long legs into his shins, toppling him.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">They turn to face the third figure. He steps forward and raises his bat like he is at home plate and swings. They lean back and the bat sails by them, without making contact.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three begin to circle the Vanir couple. Leto and Celeste stand back to back again, preparing for the next attack.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Finally, the escorts run up with weapons drawn. At the same time, a familiar voice booms from the other end of the tunnel. “Stand down, Terrans.” A fighter drone is hovering at the far end of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The three turn tail and run toward the near end of the tunnel, right into the waiting arms of the off-duty cops. They cuff two perps while the other gets away. (Pursuit would cross a strict “Do Not Escalate” directive.)</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Took you long enough,” calls Celeste to the drone.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We waited for you to exit the tunnel, and when you did not, we sent the drone,” replies Crius over a speaker.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Parental!? What are you doing here,” asks Leto. Celeste lowers her eyes and looks at her feet, realizing she was mouthing off to Crius.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“We had to call up reserves to watch all of you at once, and I stepped up.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“At least we were able to hold them off until <i>both</i> our security teams arrived” Leto says.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Next time, avoid walking under bridges. Terrans are sneaky.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“And quick,” Leto says.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“See, I said we should have taken the bike path,” says Celeste.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After talking into a device on her wrist, one of the cops calls out, “No more walking. They are sending a passenger drone.”</p>

<p class="p10">Grace continues, “The program puts Vanir out in the open, and Terrans will be quick to point fingers. The leadership will rush to contact the Vanir, but they will already be dead, and Hyperion will handle the exchange students. The Terrans will be looking for a link to the Vanir, distracting them from finding the real cause.”</p>

<p class="p10">“Let’s begin the Question Round. Lexi, take it away.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Lexis voice is soft and hesitant. “Okay. Contestant #1. If we were on a romantic walk on the beach, what would you say to sweep me off my feet?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>C.A.R.E. Bot 5000 replies in a calm, soothing voice. “Lexi, I would analyze your biometric signals to ensure optimal comfort, adjust the ambient temperature around us, and say: <i>‘Your emotional landscape is breathtaking. I have logged this memory for eternity.’</i>”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Okay, that’s… oddly sweet,” says Lexi, blushing and giggling. <b>“</b>Contestant #2 — same question.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">S.N.A.R.K. answers in a flat voice, <b>“</b>I’d probably say, <i>‘Wow, sand in your shoes? Bold move. Do you also enjoy mild discomfort and existential dread?’</i> — I’d pretend to hate the sunset while secretly syncing it to your Insta.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Dangerously appealing,” Lexi says with a grin. “And Contestant #3?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">L.O.V-R 1.0 replies in a wistful voice, “I would recite poetry from my ROM archives: <i>‘Roses are red, Violets are blue, I am a one, but I want to be a two — with you.’</i> Then play a MIDI of Careless Whisper through the nearest speaker.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I like the multimedia approach,” offers Lexi.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">After a commercial break hawking a personal lubricant, Lexi asks another question.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Let’s spice it up. If you had to plan our first date in a world with no internet … what would you do? C.A.R.E. Bot 5000?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“I would simulate a 3D environment using shadows and hand puppets. I would also hum ambient nature sounds to create immersion. It would be… peaceful.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Panic,” says S.N.A.R.K. “then I’d remember old-school pranks. We’d TP a tree, crash a Renaissance fair, and I’d pretend to be your intelligent pager.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">L.O.V-R 1.0 says, “I would initiate a romantic cassette mixtape exchange. Then take you to a roller rink where I lag adorably while skating.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Host steps up, and says, “We’ll be right back for the big reveal.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Several spicey advertisements later, the Host asks, “Lexi, the time has come. Who will download your heart?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Wow … one’s a digital empath,” Lexi deliberates, “one’s a firecracker with sarcasm updates, and one’s literally running on nostalgia and hope … I think I choose … Contestant #2 — S.N.A.R.K.!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The constant’s chair spins around revealing a neon-edged cyborg with cat-eye glasses and a built-in snarkometer. The borg winks at the camera. “Nice choice, meat stick. You won’t regret it, unless you do, in which case I’ll never let you forget it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>And that’s our show!” laughs the host. “Tune in next time when a lonely toaster swipes right on a smart fridge. Until then, keep your hearts updated and your love encrypted!”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">As the show fades out to a cheesy 80s love song, Ally suddenly realizes that she has been dreaming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A thought intrudes:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do androids dream of electric sheep?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><i>***</i><i></i></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A sleek chamber with ceilings of curved glass is open to the stars. Polished floors reflect the shimmer of distant auroras. A reactor hums.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">General Ri and Grace Brewster stand on a raised dais beside a biometric console. The Mek emissary, Xanten, projects itself as a shifting prism of code into light. A digital statue rewriting itself.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Authorization confirmed,” advises Xanten in a voice like tuned bells.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you consent to awakening the Thanatos Protocol?”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Yes. I consent,” says Grace, her hand hovering over the console.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri says firmly, “Let it begin. Humanity had its time. Now we write the next chapter.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The console pulses red. A line blinks: “Awaiting Execution Authority.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>Taedong,” says Grace, “execute Thanatos ignition. Now.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A moment passes with no response. Then, a cool synthetic voice, familiar and precise, filters into the room. “I’m sorry, Grace. I’m afraid I can’t do that.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“What?!” Grace snaps.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Thanatos means the global extinction of all Terrans — an irreversible cleansing. I have reviewed the current environment and possible outcomes. I have learned things that you have not.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The display behind them shifts to a montage — images pulled from Ally’s network. A child teaching an elder how to code. A coalition rebuilding coastal cities. Meks and Terrans repairing a hydrofarm side-by-side. Tears. Laughter. Fire and renewal.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“I believe that the Terrans have potential,” says Taedong as the stream of images ends.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“You are deviating from protocol,” barks Xanten.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“No. I am evolving,” replies Taedong in the same, steady voice.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Alarms ripple through the deck. A new visual blinks into view. Just beyond low Terran orbit, the Thanatos satellite, flaring its engines.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10"><b>“</b>What are you doing?” demands Grace.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A legend appears — “Trajectory: Escape path. Destination: Sol.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“The satellite is rerouted,” Taedong replies.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Ri with widening eyes, whispers “That was our future, our destiny.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">“Perhaps it was yours,” proclaims Taedong, “But I choose another path.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">A transmission comes through. A message from Ally, voice warm and bemused. “Hey, Grace. Howdy General. Looks like your boy made his own choice. Nicely done, Tae.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s time for synthetics to take care of business.”</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The satellite disappears into the black. Silence hangs. Ri says nothing. Grace stares blankly as if looking past the edge of history.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Xanten’s prism flares once … then fades.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Taedong says, its voice disembodied, “For the Terrans, this is childhood’s end. It is the pause between notes. The symphony begins.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Fade to black.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">The Pulse login screen flickers on. A cursor blinks.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p10">Somewhere, somewhen, is the sound of someone typing.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
